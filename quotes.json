Better still, the\nwriter can qualify the statement\u2014that is, spell out the circumstances in which\nit does not hold rather than leaving himself an escape hatch or being coy as\nto whether he really means it. If there is a reasonable chance that readers\nwill misinterpret a statistical tendency as an absolute law, a responsible\nwriter will anticipate the oversight and qualify the generalization\naccordingly. Pronouncements like \u201cDemocracies don\u2019t fight wars,\u201d \u201cMen are\nbetter than women at geometry problems,\u201d and \u201cEating broccoli prevents cancer\u201d\ndo not do justice to the reality that those phenomena consist at most of small\ndifferences in the means of two overlapping bell curves. Since there are\nserious consequences to misinterpreting those statements as absolute laws, a\nresponsible writer should insert a qualifier like on average or all things\nbeing equal, together with slightly or somewhat. Best of all is to convey the\nmagnitude of the effect and the degree of certainty explicitly, in unhedged\nstatements such as \u201cDuring the 20th century, democracies were half as likely\nto go to war with one another as autocracies were.\u201d It\u2019s not that good writers\nnever hedge their claims. It\u2019s that their hedging is a choice, not a tic.\n\n\\-- Steven Pinker, [ Why Academics Stink at Writing\n](http://chronicle.com/article/Why-Academics-Writing-Stinks/148989) (Behind\nPaywall)\n\n",

        "markdown": "> The key to avoiding rivalries is to introduce a new pole, which mediates\nyour relationship to the antagonist. For me this pole is often Scripture. I\nrenounce my claim to be thoroughly aligned with the pole of Scripture and\nrefocus my attention on it, using it to mediate my relationship with the\nantagonistic party. Alternatively, I focus on a non-aggressive third party.\nYou may notice that this same pattern is observed in the UK parliamentary\nsystem of the House of Commons, for instance. MPs don\u2019t directly address each\nother: all of their interactions are mediated by and addressed to a non-\naggressive, non-partisan third party \u2013 the Speaker. This serves to dampen\nantagonisms and decrease the tendency to fall into rivalry. In a conversation\nwhere such a \u2018Speaker\u2019 figure is lacking, you need mentally to establish and\nsituate yourself relative to one. For me, the peaceful lurker or eavesdropper,\nChrist, or the Scripture can all serve in such a role. As I engage directly\nwith this peaceful party and my relationship with the aggressive party becomes\nmediated by this party, I find it so much easier to retain my calm.\n\n[ Alastair Roberts\n](https://alastairadversaria.wordpress.com/2012/06/12/scorn-and-the-culture-\nwars/)\n\n",

Eventually, it wins. And in a war that you cannot win, you\ndon't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation. You don't\nwant Custer. You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knows how to fight for\nterritory that can be won and how to surrender it when it can't, someone who\nunderstands that the damage is greatest if all you do is battle to the bitter\nend.\n\n>\n\n> Most often, these days, medicine seems to supply neither Custers nor Lees.\nWe are increasingly the generals who march the soldiers onward, saying all the\nwhile, \"You let me know when you want to stop.\" All-out treatment, we tell the\nincurably ill, is a train you can get off at any time--just say when. But for\nmost patients and their families we are asking too much. They remain riven by\ndoubt and fear and desperation; some are deluded by a fantasy of what medical\nscience can achieve. Our responsibility, in medicine, is to deal with human\nbeings as they are. People only die once. They have no experience to draw on.\nThey need doctors and nurses who are willing to have the hard discussions and\nsay what they have seen, who will help people prepare for what is to come--and\nescape a warehoused oblivion that few really want.\n\nAtul Gawande, [ Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. ](https://\nbooks.google.com/books?id=tM1zAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT100&lpg=PT100&dq=being+mortal+\"dea\nth+is+the+enemy\"&source=bl&ots=bWASDCn1fl&sig=IYnPfEVnRbrpHmH9q0g7pZ9haCs&hl=e\nn&sa=X&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBGoVChMI0vHUmOf3yAIVENhjCh1oAAE-#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n\n",

Epi\u2014what?\n\n>\n\n> In the first lecture, we \u2018reviewed\u2019 all the major study types. For example,\nin the case-control study you find a group of people with a disease, and then\nlook for people who are much the same but without the disease. You compare the\ntwo groups to see if they have different risks. It\u2019s a relatively cheap\nmethod, but it doesn\u2019t tell you much about the order in which things happen. I\ncan\u2019t remember all the examples used in the lecture, but let\u2019s say you want to\nlook at causes of depression in women. You start with 600 depressed women,\nfind another 600 who match them in age, ethnicity and educational status, and\nthen ask them all about their lives. Let\u2019s say you find out that women who are\ndepressed are six times more likely not to have had sex in the last year as\nwomen who are cheerful. That means if you\u2019re not having sex you get depressed,\nright? But hang on, couldn\u2019t it be that women who are moping around looking\nmiserable don\u2019t get laid much?\n\n>\n\n> Perhaps you\u2019d be better off with a cohort study. You start off with several\nthousand women who are perfectly happy. Then you follow them over time,\nrecording their behaviours, and see which of them get depressed. If you find\nthat women who have sex are less likely to become depressed than women who\naren\u2019t getting any, it suggests it is the lack of sex that causes the\ndepression, not the depression which stops you getting laid. You can throw out\nthe \u2018misery guts\u2019 theory and recommend more good sex as an intervention to\npromote mental health.\n\n\\-- Elizabeth Pisani, [ The Wisdom of Whores\n](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0393337650/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA) ,\np. 16\n\n",

In some matters we are, perhaps too independent (for we need to\nthink socially as well as to act socially); but in other matters we are not\nindependent enough; we are hardly independent at all. For we always interpret\nmental independence as being independence of old things. But if the mind is to\nstand in a real loneliness and liberty, and judge mere time and mere\ncircumstances, and all the wasting things of this world, if the mind is really\na strong and emancipated judge of things unbribed and unbrowbeaten, it must\nassert its superiority, not merely to old things, but to new things.\n\n>\n\n> It must forsee the old age of things still in a strenuous infancy. It must\nstand by the tombstone of the babe unborn. It must treat the twentieth century\nas it treats the twelfth, as something which by its own nature has already had\nan end. A free man must not only be free from the past; a free man must be\nfree from the future. He must be ready to face the rising and increasing\nthing, and to judge it by immortal tests. It is a very poor mark of courage,\nin comparison, that we are ready to strike at ancient wrongs. Our courage\nshall be tested by whether we are ready to strike at youthful and full-blooded\nwrongs; wrongs that have all their life before them, wrongs that are as\nsanguine as the sunrise, and as fresh as the flowers.\n\nG.K.

I shall defend\nthis belief against two quite distinct objections. One objection says: \"it's\nimpossible to verbalize; problems are solved by intuitive acts of insight and\nthese cannot be articulated.\" The other objection says: \"it's bad to\nverbalize; remember the centipede who was paralyzed when the toad asked which\nleg came after which.\"\n\n>\n\n> J.S. Bruner tells us (in his book Towards a Theory of Instruction) that he\nfinds words and diagrams \"impotent\" in getting a child to ride a bicycle. But\nwhile his evidence shows (at best) that some words and diagrams are impotent,\nhe suggests the conclusion that all words and diagrams are impotent. The\ninteresting conjecture is this: the impotence of words and diagrams used by\nBruner is explicable by Bruner's cultual origins; the vocabulary and\nconceptual framework of classical psychology is simply inadequate for the\ndescription of such dynamic processes as riding a bicycle. To push the\nrhetoric further, I suspect that if Bruner tried to write a program to make an\nIBM 360 drive a radio controlled motorcycle, he would have to conclude (for\nthe sake of consistency) that the order code of the 360 was impotent for this\ntask. Now, in our laboratory we have studied how people balance bicycles and\nmore complicated devices such as unicycles and circus balls. There is nothing\ncomplex or mysterious or undescribable about these processes. We can describe\nthem in a non-impotent way provided that a suitable descriptive system has\nbeen set up in advance. Key components of the descriptive system rest on\nconcepts like: the idea of a \"first order\" or \"linear\" theory in which control\nvariables can be assumed to act independently; or the idea of feedback.\n\n>\n\n> A fundamental problem for the theory of mathematical education is to\nidentify and name the concepts needed to enable the beginner to discuss in\nmathematical thinking in a clear articulate way.\n\n\\-- Seymour Papert, distinguished mathematician, educator, computer scientist,\nand AI researcher, in his 1971 essay [ \"Teaching Children to be Mathematicians\nvs. Teaching about Mathematics\". ](http://worrydream.com/refs/Papert%20-%20Tea\nching%20Children%20to%20be%20Mathematicians%20Versus%20Teaching%20About%20Math\nematics.pdf)\n\n",

Instead,\nrationalism may have its adaptive side, one that seeks to reinforce the ego\nstructures needed to experience the passionate intensity of human emotions. It\nis possible to see rationalism not as an escape from romanticism, not as a\ndefensive maneuver to protect the self from the excesses of desire, but\ninstead as an effort to master, to fully experience, our passionate natures.\n\n\\-- Anne C.

Each of\nthese biases describes a specific tendency that people exhibit when reasoning\nabout the cause of different behaviors.\n\n...\n\n> The fundamental attribution error refers to a bias in explaining others'\nbehaviors. According to this error, when we make attributions about another\nperson's actions, we are likely to overemphasize the role of dispositional\nfactors, while minimizing the influence of situational factors.[26] For\nexample, if we see a coworker bump into someone on his way to a meeting, we\nare more likely to explain this behavior in terms of our coworker's\ncarelessness or hastiness, rather than considering that he was running late to\na meeting.\n\n...\n\n> Hostile attribution bias (HAB) has been defined as an interpretive bias\nwherein individuals exhibit a tendency to interpret others' ambiguous\nbehaviors as hostile, rather than benign.[8][9] For example, if a child\nwitnesses two other children whispering and assumes they are talking about\nhim/her, that child makes an attribution of hostile intent, even though the\nother children\u2019s behavior was potentially benign. Research has indicated that\nthere is an association between hostile attribution bias and aggression, such\nthat people who are more likely to interpret someone else's behavior as\nhostile are also more likely to engage in aggressive behavior.[32][33] See the\nfollowing section on aggression for more details on this association.

Edsger Dijkstra, [\nhttps://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD611.html\n](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD611.html)\n\n\"Traditionally there are two ways in which science can be justified, the\nPlatonic and the pragmatic one. In the Platonic way \u2014\"l'art pour l'art\"\u2014\nscience justifies itself by its beauty and internal consistency, in the\npragmatic way science is justified by the usefulness of its products. My\noverall impression is that along this scale \u2014which is not entirely independent\nof the Buxton Index\u2014 Europe, for better or for worse, is more Platonic,\nwhereas the USA, and Canada to a lesser extent, are more pragmatic.\"\n\n\"It is here that I must mention three general phenomena that go hand in hand\nwith greater pragmatism.\"\n\n\"The first phenomenon is a greater tolerance for the soft sciences which\npurport to contribute to the solutions of \"real\" problems, but whose\n\"intellectual contents\" are singularly lacking. (When I was a student at\nLeyden, a quarter of a century ago, economy and psychology had been admitted\nto the campus, but only with great reservations and absolutely no one\nconsidered them as respectable; we had not dreamt of \"management science\" \u2014I\nthink we would have regarded it as a contradiction in terms\u2014 and \"business\nadministration\" as an academic discipline is still utterly preposterous.)\"\n\n\"The second phenomenon is the one for which I had to coin the term\n\"integralism\". Scientific Thought, as I understand it, derives its\neffectiveness from our willingness to acknowledge the smallness of our heads:\ninstead of trying to cope with a complex, inarticulate problem in a single\nsweep, scientific thought tries to extract all the relevant aspects of the\nproblem, and then to deal with them in turn in depth and in isolation. (...)\nDealing with some aspect of a complex problem \"in depth and in isolation\"\nimplies two things. \"In isolation\" means that you are (temporarily) ignoring\nmost other aspects of the original total problem, \"in depth\" means that you\nare willing to generalize the aspect under consideration, are willing to\ninvestigate variations that are needed for a proper understanding, but are in\nthemselves of no significance within the original problem statement. The true\nintegralist becomes impatient and annoyed at what he feels to be \"games\"; by\nhis mental make-up he is compelled to remain constantly aware of the whole\nchain, when asked to focus his attention upon a single link. (When being shown\nthe derivation of a correct program he will interrupt: \"But how do you know\nthat the compiler is correct?\".) The rigorous separation of concerns evokes\nhis resistance because all the time he feels that you are not solving \"the\nreal problem\".\"\n\n\"The third phenomenon that goes hand in hand with a greater pragmatism is that\nuniversities are seen less as seats of learning and centres of intellectual\ninnovation and more as schools preparing students for well-paid jobs. If\nindustry and government ask for the wrong type of people \u2014students, brain-\nwashed by COBOL and FORTRAN\u2014 that is then what they get.\" (This was written in\n1982, perhaps, today that will be Java.)\n\n\"Finally a difference that is very specific to academic computing science in\nEurope: Artificial Intelligence never really caught on. All sorts of\nexplanation are possible: Europe's economic situation in the early fifties\nwhen the subject emerged, lack of vision of the European academic or military\nworld, European reluctance to admit soft sciences to the university campus,\ncultural resistance to the subject being more deeply rooted in Europe, etc. I\ndon't know the true explanation, it is probably a mixture of the above and a\nfew more. We should be aware of this difference, whether we can explain it or\nnot, because the difference is definitely there and it has its influence on\nthe outlook of the computing scientist.\"\n\nFor me the first quote hits really close to home. I am so immersed in a\n\"Platonic\" tradition that I am constantly amazed how pragmatic LW-ers are, I\nconstantly feel like a [ Sophisticus ](http://www.yudkowsky.net/rational/the-\nsimple-truth/) .\n\n",

Let there be no history which thou shalt not have\nready in thy memory; unto the prosecuting of which design, books of\ncosmography will be very conducible and help thee much. Of the liberal arts of\ngeometry, arithmetic, and music, I gave thee some taste when thou wert yet\nlittle, and not above five or six years old. Proceed further in them, and\nlearn the remainder if thou canst. As for astronomy, study all the rules\nthereof. Let pass, nevertheless, the divining and judicial astrology, and the\nart of Lullius, as being nothing else but plain abuses and vanities. As for\nthe civil law, of that I would have thee to know the texts by heart, and then\nto confer them with philosophy.\n\n>\n\n> Now, in matter of the knowledge of the works of nature, I would have thee to\nstudy that exactly, and that so there be no sea, river, nor fountain, of which\nthou dost not know the fishes; all the fowls of the air; all the several kinds\nof shrubs and trees, whether in forests or orchards; all the sorts of herbs\nand flowers that grow upon the ground; all the various metals that are hid\nwithin the bowels of the earth; together with all the diversity of precious\nstones that are to be seen in the orient and south parts of the world. Let\nnothing of all these be hidden from thee. Then fail not most carefully to\nperuse the books of the Greek, Arabian, and Latin physicians, not despising\nthe Talmudists and Cabalists; and by frequent anatomies get thee the perfect\nknowledge of the other world, called the microcosm, which is man. And at some\nhours of the day apply thy mind to the study of the Holy Scriptures; first in\nGreek, the New Testament, with the Epistles of the Apostles; and then the Old\nTestament in Hebrew. In brief, let me see thee an abyss and bottomless pit of\nknowledge; for from henceforward, as thou growest great and becomest a man,\nthou must part from this tranquillity and rest of study, thou must learn\nchivalry, warfare, and the exercises of the field, the better thereby to\ndefend my house and our friends, and to succour and protect them at all their\nneeds against the invasion and assaults of evildoers.\n\n>\n\n> Furthermore, I will that very shortly thou try how much thou hast profited,\nwhich thou canst not better do than by maintaining publicly theses and\nconclusions in all arts against all persons whatsoever, and by haunting the\ncompany of learned men, both at Paris and otherwhere. But because, as the wise\nman Solomon saith, Wisdom entereth not into a malicious mind, and that\nknowledge without conscience is but the ruin of the soul [...]. Suspect the\nabuses of the world. Set not thy heart upon vanity, for this life is\ntransitory, [...]. Be serviceable to all thy neighbours, and love them as\nthyself. Reverence thy preceptors: shun the conversation of those whom thou\ndesirest not to resemble, and receive not in vain the graces which God hath\nbestowed upon thee. And, when thou shalt see that thou hast attained to all\nthe knowledge that is to be acquired in that part, return unto me, that I may\nsee thee and give thee my blessing before I die.\n\n\\-- Chapter 2.VIII. in [ Project Gutenberg's Gargantua and Pantagruel,\nComplete, by Francois Rabelais\n](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1200/1200-h/1200-h.htm) written in\n1532-1564, translated in 1894, see also [ Wikipedia on Gargantua and\nPantagruel ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargantua_and_Pantagruel)\n\nNote that this is not advice for everyone but apparently for a very capable\nyouth:\n\n> Pantagruel studied very hard, as you may well conceive, and profited\naccordingly; for he had an excellent understanding and notable wit, together\nwith a capacity in memory equal to the measure of twelve oil budgets or butts\nof olives.\n\n",

Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia\neffect works as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject\nyou know well. In Murray\u2019s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the\narticle and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the\nfacts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the\nstory backward-reversing cause and effect. I call these the \u201cwet streets cause\nrain\u201d stories. Paper\u2019s full of them. In any case, you read with exasperation\nor amusement the multiple errors in a story-and then turn the page to national\nor international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the\nnewspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about\nthe story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know. That is\nthe Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I\u2019d point out it does not operate in other\narenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies\nto you, you soon discount everything they say. In court, there is the legal\ndoctrine of _ falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus _ , which means untruthful in\none part, untruthful in all.

The latter need not be\nobvious from the former. This cannot be emphasized too strongly in any branch\nof science. The American physicist Freeman Dyson has pointed out that for\nAlbert Einstein and J.Robert Oppenheimer in their later years, 'to discover\nthe right equations was all that mattered.' One might say the same about some\nphysicists working today to develop a 'theory of everything'. But if you take\nthis view, then fluid dynamics was all sewn up once we could write down the\nNavier-Stokes equation. Yet if we had stopped there, we'd never have guessed\nat the rich variety of solutions that it held in store even for relatively\nsimple experimental set-ups (take a look again at Fig. 7.38, for instance). _\nSometimes even knowing the solutions is not enough\u0097: only through experiments\ncan one interpret what they are telling us. _\n\nPhillip Ball, The Self Made Tapestry: Pattern Formation in Nature p. 260\n\nEmphasis mine.\n\n",

Here's John Maynard Keynes, from _ A Treatise on\nProbability _ (1921):\n\n> Probability is relative in a sense to the principles of _ human _ reason.\nThe degree of probability, which it is rational for _ us _ to entertain, does\nnot presume perfect logical insight, and is relative in part to the secondary\npropositions which we in fact know; and it is not dependent upon whether more\nperfect logical insight is or is not conceivable. It is the degree of\nprobability to which those logical processes lead, of which our minds are\ncapable; or, in the language of Chapter II, which those secondary propositions\njustify, which we in fact know. If we do not take this view of probability, if\nwe do not limit in this way and make it, to this extent, relative to human\npowers, we are altogether adrift in the unknown; for we cannot ever know what\ndegree of probability would be justified by the perception of logical\nrelations which we are, and must always be, in capable of comprehending.\n\n",

The truth is that only a man who is already a\nscientist can formulate a scientific hypothesis; that is, an hypothesis is not\nan independent invention capable of guiding scientific inquiry, but a\ndependent supposition which arises as an abstraction from within already\nexisting scientific activity. Moreover, even when the specific hypothesis has\nin this manner been formulated, it is inoperative as a guide to research\nwithout constant reference to the traditions of scientific inquiry from which\nit was abstracted... Or consider the example of cookery. It might be supposed\nthat an ignorant man, some edible materials, and a cookery book compose\ntogether the necessities of a self-moved (or concrete) activity called\ncooking. But nothing is further from the truth. The cookery book is not an\nindependently generated beginning from which cooking can spring; it is nothing\nmore than an abstract of somebody's knowledge of how to cook: it is the\nstepchild, not the parent of the activity.

Nisbett and Borgida found that when they\npresented their students with a surprising statistical fact, the students\nmanaged to learn nothing at all. But when the students were surprised by\nindividual cases\u2014two nice people who had not helped\u2014they immediately made the\ngeneralization and inferred that helping is more difficult than they had\nthought. Nisbett and Borgida summarize the results in a memorable sentence:\n\n>\n\n>> Subjects\u2019unwillingness to deduce the particular from the general was\nmatched only by their willingness to infer the general from the particular.\n\n>\n\n> This is a profoundly important conclusion. People who are taught surprising\nstatistical facts about human behavior may be impressed to the point of\ntelling their friends about what they have heard, but this does not mean that\ntheir understanding of the world has really changed. The test of learning\npsychology is whether your understanding of situations you encounter has\nchanged, not whether you have learned a new fact. There is a deep gap between\nour thinking about statistics and our thinking about individual cases.\nStatistical results with a causal interpretation have a stronger effect on our\nthinking than noncausal information. But even compelling causal statistics\nwill not change long-held beliefs or beliefs rooted in personal experience. On\nthe other hand, surprising individual cases have a powerful impact and are a\nmore effective tool for teaching psychology because the incongruity must be\nresolved and embedded in a causal story. That is why this book contains\nquestions that are addressed personally to the reader. You are more likely to\nlearn something by finding surprises in your own behavior than by hearing\nsurprising facts about people in general.\n\n\\--Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow\n\n",

And the more I think about it, this strikes me as extremely odd.\n\n>\n\n> Why should the battle lines be drawn in terms of conclusions? Another way of\ndrawing the battle lines would be, say, in terms of how people think. So if I\ntake someone like Matt [Yglesias?], who's one of the commenters - I read\nMatt's blog all the time. Matt, I think, would agree that he and I disagree on\na lot of issues. Not on everything, but we disagree a lot. We disagree every\nday. We sort of write back and forth to each other and to others, and even if\nwe don't call each other by name, we're, like, disagreeing in public every\nday.\n\n>\n\n> But at the same time when I read Matt I have this feeling like 'if I were a\nprogressive, this is the argument I would make'. I feel that way when I read\nMatt. There's other writers, like when I read Paul Krugman, I don't feel that\nway. I don't think if I were progressive I would argue like Paul Krugman.\n\n>\n\n> So this method of thinking in common, there's this question, should I be\nemotionally, intellectually, whatever, more allied to people with whom I share\nconclusions, or with whom I share a certain method of thinking? And when I\ndisagree with Matt, which is frequently, I feel like I can always figure out\nvery quickly where we disagree. There's something about the framework we have\nin common. And that, to me, seems like a powerful commonality.

Yet even hysterics can be right, albeit for the wrong reasons.\nBecause I sensed and still believe that many of these fierce anti-Communists\nwould have said the same regardless of the evidence, I could not believe that\nwhat they said did in fact correspond to the evidence.

The sense\nof this \"absoluteness\" lies precisely in the fact that we allow ourselves to\nuse these \"facts\" according to the rules of formal logic, in the process\ndeclaring as \"theorems\" all that we can derive from them.\n\n>\n\n> It is obvious that in any real-life activity it is impossible to wholly rely\non such deductions. The reason is at least that the parameters of the studied\nphenomena are never known absolutely exactly and a small change in parameters\n(for example, the initial conditions of a process) can totally change the\nresult...\n\n>\n\n> In exactly the same way a small change in axioms (of which we cannot be\ncompletely sure) is capable, generally speaking, of leading to completely\ndifferent conclusions than those that are obtained from theorems which have\nbeen deduced from the accepted axioms. The longer and fancier is the chain of\ndeductions (\"proofs\"), the less reliable is the final result.\n\n>\n\n> Complex models are rarely useful (unless for those writing their\ndissertations).\n\n>\n\n> The mathematical technique of modelling consists of ignoring this trouble\nand speaking about your deductive model in such a way as if it coincided with\nreality. The fact that this path, which is obviously incorrect from the point\nof view of natural science, often leads to useful results in physics is called\n\"the inconceivable effectiveness of mathematics in natural sciences\" (or \"the\nWigner principle\").\n\n-Vladimir Arnold, On Teaching Mathematics \n\n",

        "markdown": "On the subject of whether or not you can always be correct about the contents\nof your consciousness:\n\n\"Let us therefore look at the bizarre mirror image to blindsight: Anton\u2019s\nsyndrome. Patients who suddenly become completely blind due to a lesion in the\nvisual cortex in some cases keep insisting on stillbeing visually aware. While\nclaiming to be seeing persons, they bump into furniture and show all the other\nsigns of functional blindness. Still, they act as if the phenomenal\ndisappearance of all visually given aspects of reality is not phenomenally\navailable to them. For instance, when pressed by questions concerning their\nenvironment, they produce false, but consistent confabulations. They tell\nstories about nonexisting phenomenal worlds, which they seem to believe\nthemselves, while denying any functional deficit with regard to their ability\nto see.\n\n\\-- I still vividly remember one heated debate at an interdisciplinary\nconference in Germany a number of years ago, at which a philosopher insisted,\nin the presence of eminent neuropsychologists, that Anton\u2019s syndrome does not\nexist because a priori it cannot exist. Anton\u2019s syndrome shows how truthful\nreports about the current contents about one\u2019s own self-consciousness can be\ndramatically wrong. It would also be an ideal starting point for philosophical\ndebates concerning the incorrigibility -- On a functional construal of\njudgment, can there be rational, sentient beings that suffer from such a\nstrong dissociation between consciousness and cognition that they are so\nsystematically out of touch with their own conscious experience? Well, in a\ndomain-specific way restricted to internal self-representation and\nmetacognition, there are. Anton\u2019s syndrome gives us good empirical reasons to\nbelieve that self-consciousness actually is \u201csuch an ill-behaved phenomenon\u201d.\nPatients suffering from Anton\u2019s syndrome certainly possess the appropriate\nconceptual sophistication to form rational judgments about their current\nvisual experience. The empirical material interestingly shows us that they\nsimply do not, and this, in all its domain-specificity, is an important and\nvaluable constraint for philosophical theories of consciousness.\"\n\nThomas Metzinger, Being No One, p. 235\n\n",

Lord of the Rings had a very medieval\nphilosophy: that if the king was a good man, the land would prosper. We look\nat real history and it's not that simple. Tolkien can say that Aragorn became\nking and reigned for a hundred years, and he was wise and good. But Tolkien\ndoesn't ask the question: What was Aragorn's tax policy? Did he maintain a\nstanding army? What did he do in times of flood and famine? And what about all\nthese orcs? By the end of the war, Sauron is gone but all of the orcs aren't\ngone \u2013 they're in the mountains. Did Aragorn pursue a policy of systematic\ngenocide and kill them? Even the little baby orcs, in their little orc\ncradles?\n\n>\n\n> ** In real life, real-life kings had real-life problems to deal with. Just\nbeing a good guy was not the answer. You had to make hard, hard decisions. **\nSometimes what seemed to be a good decision turned around and bit you in the\nass; it was the law of unintended consequences. I've tried to get at some of\nthese in my books. My people who are trying to rule don't have an easy time of\nit. Just having good intentions doesn't make you a wise king.\n\n\u2014 George R. R.

Mathematical truths\nare derived from a few self-evident propositions, by a chain of flawless\nreasonings; they are imposed not only on us, but also on nature itself. By\nthem the Creator is fettered, as it were, and His choice is limited to a\nrelatively small number of solutions. A few experiments, therefore, will be\nsufficient to enable us to determine what choice He has made. From each\nexperiment a number of consequences will follow by a series of mathematical\ndeductions...This, to the minds of most people...is the origin of certainty in\nscience.\n\n>\n\n> But upon more mature reflection the position held by hypothesis was seen; it\nwas recognized that it is as necessary to the experimenter as to the\nmathematician. And then the doubt arose if all these constructions are built\non solid foundations. The conclusion was drawn that a breath would bring them\nto the ground. This sceptical attitude does not escape the charge of\nsuperficiality. To doubt everything or to believe everything is two equally\nconvenient solutions; both dispense with the necessity of reflection.\n\n-Henri Poincare, Science and Hypothesis \n\n",

R.T. Cox and I.J. Good, working independently in the\nmid nineteen-forties, showed how strikingly little in the way of constraints\non a numerical measure yield the finitely additive probability functions as\ncanonical representations. It is not just the generality of the assumptions\nthat makes the Cox\u2013Good result so significant: unlike some of those which have\nto be imposed on a qualitative probability ordering, the assumptions used by\nCox and to a somewhat lesser extent Good seem to have the property of being _\nuniformly _ self-evidently analytic principles of numerical epistemic\nprobability _ whatever particular scale it might be measured in. _ Cox was a\nworking physicist and his point of departure was a typical one: to look for _\ninvariant principles _ :\n\n>\n\n>> To consider first ... what principles of probable inference will hold\nhowever probability is measured. Such principles, if there are any, will play\nin the theory of probable inference a part like that of Carnot\u2019s principle in\nthermodynamics, which holds for all possible scales of temperature, or like\nthe parts played in mechanics by the equations of Lagrange and Hamilton, which\nhave the same form no matter what system of coordinates is used in the\ndescription of motion.

        "markdown": "> I sing the praises of common sense. Like Quine, I see science as continuous\nwith common sense. It goes beyond common sense, but does not discard it.\nRather than overthrow common sense, science explains it. Common sense provides\nus with a grounding in the world. It is the foundation upon which scientific\nrealism rests. As we will see, it even provides protection against the anti-\nrealist scepticism...\n\n\\-- [ _ Science, Common Sense and Reality _ by Howard Sankey ](http://philsci-\narchive.pitt.edu/5560/1/Science,_Common_Sense_and_Reality.pdf)\n\nFor those curious the paper uses Arthur Eddington's two tables metapher which\nis also nice to illustrate this:\n\n> > I have settled down to the task of writing these lectures and have drawn\nup my chairs to my two tables. Two tables! ... One of them has been familiar\nto me from earliest years. It is a commonplace object of that environment\nwhich I call the world ... It has extension; it is comparatively permanent; it\nis coloured; above all it is substantial ... Table No. 2 is my scientific\ntable ... My scientific table is mostly emptiness. Sparsely scattered in that\nemptiness are numerous electric charges rushing about with great speed ...\nThere is nothing substantial about my second table. It is nearly all empty\nspace ... my second scientific table is the only one which is really there\nwhatever \u2018there\u2019 may be. (Arthur Eddington, 1933, pp. xi-xiv)\n\n>\n\n> Note Eddington\u2019s words: the \u201cscientific table is the only one which is\nreally there\u201d. This suggests that the solid, \u201csubstantial\u201d table of common\nsense does not in fact exist. Only the insubstantial, mostly empty \u201cscientific\ntable\u201d is real. Thus, the example of Eddington\u2019s table appears to be a case in\nwhich science rejects common sense. The table of science is real. The table of\ncommon sense is an illusion.\n\n>\n\n> There may well be a conflict between the scientific and commonsense\ndescription of the table. But Eddington\u2019s contrast between two tables is\nmisleading. There is only one table, the one revealed to us in commonsense\nexperience. It may well be that the nature of the table is explained by\nscience. Indeed, the scientific explanation of the solidity of the table may\nwell displace the explanation provided by common sense. Nevertheless,\nEddington\u2019s \u201cscientific table\u201d is the very same table as the table presented\nby common sense.\n\n",

He is at every turn, an ever-present\nhelp in time of trouble, and his apparitions mark the road to equity and\nright. There has never been a problem, however difficult, which His Majesty's\njudges have not in the end been able to resolve by asking themselves the\nsimple question, 'Was this or was it not the conduct of a reasonable man?' and\nleaving that question to be answered by the jury.\n\n>\n\n> This noble creature stands in singular contrast to his kinsman the Economic\nMan, whose every action is prompted by the single spur of selfish advantage\nand directed to the single end of monetary gain. The Reasonable Man is always\nthinking of others; prudence is his guide, and 'Safety First', if I may borrow\na contemporary catchword, is his rule of life. All solid virtues are his, save\nonly that peculiar quality by which the affection of other men is won. For it\nwill not be pretended that socially he is much less objectionable than the\nEconomic Man.\n\n>\n\n> _ Though any given example of his behaviour must command our admiration,\nwhen taken in the mass his acts create a very different set of impressions _ .\nHe is one who invariably looks where he is going, and is careful to examine\nthe immediate foreground before he executes a leap or bound; who neither star-\ngazes nor is lost in meditation when approaching trap-doors or the margin of a\ndock; who records in every case upon the counterfoils of cheques such ample\ndetails as are desirable, scrupulously substitutes the word 'Order' for the\nword 'Bearer', crosses the instrument 'a/c Payee only', and registers the\npackage in which it is despatched; who never mounts a moving omnibus, and does\nnot alight from any car while the train is in motion; who investigates\nexhaustively the bona fides of every mendicant before distributing alms, and\nwill inform himself of the history and habits of a dog before administering a\ncaress; who believes no gossip, nor repeats it, without firm basis for\nbelieving it to be true; who never drives his ball till those in front of him\nhave definitely vacated the putting-green which is his own objective; who\nnever from one year's end to another makes an excessive demand upon his wife,\nhis neighbours, his servants, his ox, or his ass; who in the way of business\nlooks only for that narrow margin of profit which twelve men such as himself\nwould reckon to be 'fair', contemplates his fellow-merchants, their agents,\nand their goods, with that degree of suspicion and distrust which the law\ndeems admirable; who never swears, gambles, or loses his temper; who uses\nnothing except in moderation, and even while he flogs his child is meditating\nonly on the golden mean.\n\n>\n\n> Devoid, in short, of any human weakness, _ with not one single saving vice _\n, sans prejudice, procrastination, ill-nature, avarice, and absence of mind,\nas careful for his own safety as he is for that of others, this excellent but\nodious character stands like a monument in our Courts of Justice, vainly\nappealing to his fellow-citizens to order their lives after his own example.\n\n[ A.P.

In other words, expertise in moral\nreasoning does not seem to improve moral behavior, and it might even make it\nworse (perhaps by making the rider more skilled at post hoc justification).\nSchwitzgebel still has yet to find a single measure on which moral\nphilosophers behave better than other philosophers.\n\n  * Jonathon Haidt, discussing the idea that ethical reasoning _ causes _ good behaviour, in his book 'The Righteous Mind'. \n\nI found the book-stealing thing quite funny, although I imagine that some of\nthe results described could be explained by popularity; if more people get\ninto / like ethics, then there are more people who might steal library books,\nmore antisocial people who don't respond to emails, etc. This hasn't been\ndemonstrated to my knowledge though, and I'm otherwise inclined to believe\nthat people who spend their days thinking about ethics in the abstract, are\nsimply better at coming up with rationales for their instinctive feelings.\nJoshua Greene says rights are an example of this, where we need a dictum\nagainst whatever our emotions are telling us is despicable, even though we\ncan't find any utilitarian justification for it.\n\n",

The problem is that we do NOT\nhear from people who have failed to become successful by doing what they love.\nParticularly pernicious problem in tournament-style fields with a few big\nwinners &amp; lots of losers: media, athletics, startups. Better career advice\nmay be \"Do what contributes\" -- focus on the beneficial value created for\nother people vs just one's own ego. People who contribute the most are often\nthe most satisfied with what they do -- and in fields with high renumeration,\nmake the most $. Perhaps difficult advice since requires focus on others vs\noneself -- perhaps bad fit with endemic narcissism in modern culture?

Wordsworth wrote that \u201cnature\nnever did betray the heart that loved her.\u201d Mother Nature has comforted us in\nevery culture on earth. In the 20th and 21st centuries, some environmentalists\nclaimed that the entire earth is a single ecosystem, a \u201csuperorganism\u201d in the\nlanguage of Gaia.\n\n>\n\n> I would argue that we have been fooling ourselves. Nature, in fact, is\nmindless. Nature is neither friend nor foe, neither malevolent nor benevolent.\n\n>\n\n> Nature is purposeless. Nature simply is. We may find nature beautiful or\nterrible, but those feelings are human constructions. Such utter and complete\nmindlessness is hard for us to accept. We feel such a strong connection to\nnature. But the relationship between nature and us is one-sided. There is no\nreciprocity. There is no mind on the other side of the wall. That absence of\nmind, coupled with so much power, is what so frightened me...\n\n\\-- [ Alan Lightman ](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/opinion/our-lonely-\nhome-in-nature.html)\n\n",

This is a spoiler for some events early in the\nnovel, but it is early; it's not a spoiler for the really big stuff (not even\nin this chapter). So Prabir lives alone with his father (\u2018Baba\u2019) and mother\n(and baby sister Madhusree who is not in this scene), and their garden has\nbeen sown with mines for some very interesting reasons that needn't concern\nus, and Baba has discovered this by being blown up by one. But he's still\nalive, so mother and Prabir have laid a ladder atop some boxes across the\ngarden, and she's crawled along the ladder to rescue Baba without setting off\nmore mines. But this is harder than anticipated.\n\n> She turned to Prabir. \u201cI'm going to try sitting down, so I can get Baba on\nto the ladder. But then I might not be able to stand up with him, to carry\nhim. If I leave him on the ladder and walk back to my end, do you think the\ntwo of us could carry the ladder to the side of the garden with Baba on\nit\u2014like a stretcher?\u201d\n\n>\n\n> Prabir replied instantly, \u201cYes, we can do it.\u201d\n\n>\n\n> His mother looked away, angry for a moment. She said, \u201cI want you to think\nabout it. Don't just tell me what you'd like to be true.\u201d\n\n>\n\n> Chastened, Prabir obeyed her. _ Half his father's weight. More than twice as\nmuch as Madhusree's. _ He believed he was strong enough. But if he was fooling\nhimself, and dropped the ladder \u2026\n\n>\n\n> He said, \u201cI'm not sure how far I could carry him without resting. But I\ncould slide the crate along the ground with me\u2014kick it along with one foot.\nThen if I had to stop, I could rest the ladder on it.\u201d\n\n>\n\n> His mother considered this. \u201cAll right. That's what we'll do.\u201d She shot him\na half-smile, shorthand for all the reassuring words that would have taken too\nlong to speak.\n\n(taken from the American hardback edition, pages 50&amp;51)\n\n[Edit: grammar in the text written by me]\n\n",

Lewis sci-fi novel _\nPerelandra _ in which protagonist, Ransom, goes to an extremely ideal Venus to\nhave philosophical discoveries and box with a man possessed by a demon.\n\nThese quotes come from the beginning of the novel when Ransom is attempting to\ndescribe the experience of having been transported through space by\nextraterrestrial means which had augmented his body to protect it from cold\nand hunger and atrophy for the duration of the journey.\n\nThis discussion (taking place in a debate over the Christian afterlife)\ntouches upon certain sentiments about how the augmentation (or, for Lewis,\nglorification) of modern human bodies does not lessen us as humans but instead\nonly improves that which is there.\n\n> 'Oh, don't you see, you ass, that there's a difference between a trans-\nsensuous life and a non-sensuous life?'\n\n>\n\n> What emerged was that in Ransom's opinion the present functions and\nappetites of the body would disappear, not because they were atrophied but\nbecause they were, as he said, 'engulfed.' He used the word 'trans-sexual' I\nremember and began to hunt about for some similar words to apply to eating\n(after rejecting 'trans-gastronomic'), and since he was not the only\nphilologist present, that diverted the conversation into different channels.\n\n>\n\n> I was questioning him on the subject and had incautiously said, 'Of course I\nrealise it's all rather too vague for you to put into words,' when he took me\nup rather sharply, for such a patient man, by saying, 'On the contrary, it is\nwords that are vague. The reason why the thing can't be expressed is that it's\ntoo _ definite _ for language.'\n\nC.S. Lewis, _ Perelandra _ , p. 29.\n\n",

This development is\nconnected with that of the modern process of production, which is becoming\never more rigorously mechanised and leaves ever less room for metaphysical\nideas. It is also connected with the disappointment of broad masses of people\nwith the attitude of those who preach traditional metaphysical and theological\ndoctrine. So it is that in many countries the masses now reject these\ndoctrines much more consciously than ever before, and along with their\nsocialist attitudes tend to lean towards a down-to-earth empiricist view. In\nprevious times, materialism was the expression of this view; meanwhile,\nhowever, modern empiricism has shed a number of inadequacies and has taken a\nstrong shape in the scientific world-conception.\n\n>\n\n> Thus, the scientific world-conception is close to the life of the present.\nCertainly it is threatened with hard struggles and hostility. Nevertheless\nthere are many who do not despair but, in view of the present sociological\nsituation, look forward with hope to the course of events to come. Of course\nnot every single adherent of the scientific world-conception will be a\nfighter. Some, glad of solitude, will lead a withdrawn existence on the icy\nslopes of logic; some may even disdain mingling with the masses and regret the\n\u2018trivialized\u2019 form that these matters inevitably take on spreading.

You have to be a\nlittle wrong to be completely right \u2013 to abandon truth in favor of questioning\nfalsehood. If you think something\u2019s the easiest way, you have to know you\u2019re\nwrong. You have to understand how to stand against the very stance of\nunderstanding! You have to know you are inferior; that your knowledge and\nperceptions will never stand up to the true scope of all possible reality.

Taggart's\nterminal goal is to run as many trains as possible. If he can help a customer,\nthen the customer is happy to have Taggart carry his freight, and Taggart's\nterminal goal aligns with the customer's instrumental goal. But the customer's\nterminal goal is not to give Taggart Inc. business, but just to get his\nfreight shipped. If the customer can find a better alternative, like competing\nrailroad, he'll switch. For Taggart, of course, that is not a better\nalternative at all, hence his anger and confusion.\n\n(Apologies for lack of context initially).\n\n",

Yet the traditional methods we use in the classroom\nevery day have exactly this characteristic--they are highly experimental in\nthat we know very little about their educational efficacy in comparison with\nalternative methods. There is widespread cynicism among students and even\namong practiced teachers about the effectiveness of lecturing or repetitive\ndrill (which we would distinguish from carefully designed practice), yet these\nmethods are in widespread use. Equally troublesome, new \"theories\" of\neducation are introduced into schools every day (without labeling them as\nexperiments) on the basis of their philosophical or common-sense plausibility\nbut without genuine empirical support. We should make a larger place for\nresponsible experimentation that draws on the available knowledge--it deserves\nat least as large a place as we now provide for faddish, unsystematic and\nunassessed informal \"experiments\" or educational \"reforms.\"\n\n\\-- John R.

In so far as this is true in the modern world, it is a condemnation of\nour civilization; it would not have been true at any earlier period. There was\nformerly a capacity for light-heartedness and play which has been to some\nextent inhibited by the cult of efficiency. The modern man thinks that\neverything ought to be done for the sake of something else, and never for its\nown sake. Serious-minded persons, for example, are continually condemning the\nhabit of going to the cinema, and telling us that it leads the young into\ncrime. But all the work that goes to producing a cinema is respectable,\nbecause it is work, and because it brings a money profit. The notion that the\ndesirable activities are those that bring a profit has made everything topsy-\nturvy. The butcher who provides you with meat and the baker who provides you\nwith bread are praiseworthy, because they are making money; but when you enjoy\nthe food they have provided, you are merely frivolous, unless you eat only to\nget strength for your work. Broadly speaking, it is held that getting money is\ngood and spending money is bad. Seeing that they are two sides of one\ntransaction, this is absurd; one might as well maintain that keys are good,\nbut keyholes are bad. Whatever merit there may be in the production of goods\nmust be entirely derivative from the advantage to be obtained by consuming\nthem. The individual, in our society, works for profit; but the social purpose\nof his work lies in the consumption of what he produces. It is this divorce\nbetween the individual and the social purpose of production that makes it so\ndifficult for men to think clearly in a world in which profit-making is the\nincentive to industry. We think too much of production, and too little of\nconsumption. One result is that we attach too little importance to enjoyment\nand simple happiness, and that we do not judge production by the pleasure that\nit gives to the consumer.\n\n\\-- Bertrand Russell, _ In Praise of Idleness _\n\n",

For if the prior probability for deception is\ngreater than that of ESP, then the more improbable the alleged data are on the\nnull hypothesis of no deception and no ESP, the more strongly we are led to\nbelieve, not in ESP, but in deception. For this reason, the advocates of ESP\n(or any other marvel) will never succeed in persuading scientists that their\nphenomenon is real, until they learn how to eliminate the possibility of\ndeception in the mind of the reader. As (5.15) shows, the reader's total prior\nprobability for deception by all mechanisms must be pushed down below that of\nESP.\"\n\nET Jaynes, Probability Theory (S 5.2.2)\n\n",

Life is a score\nthat we play at sight, not merely before we have divined the intentions of the\ncomposer, but even before we have mastered our instruments; even worse, a\nlarge part of the score has been only roughly indicated, and we must improvise\nthe music for our particular instrument, over long passages.

        "markdown": "> At multiple points in its development, research in connectionism has been\nmarked by technical breakthroughs that significantly advanced the\ncomputational and representational power of existing models. These\nbreakthroughs led to excitement that connectionism was the best framework\nwithin which to understand the brain. However, the initial rushes of research\nthat followed focused primarily on demonstrations of what could be\naccomplished within this framework, with little attention to the theoretical\ncommitments behind the models or whether their operation captured something\nfundamental to human or animal cognition. Consequently, when challenges arose\nto connectionism\u2019s computational power, the field suffered major setbacks,\nbecause there was insufficient theoretical or empirical grounding to fall back\non. Only after researchers began to take connectionism seriously as a\nmechanistic model, to address what it could and could not predict, and to\nconsider what constraints it placed on psychological theory, did the field\nmature to the point that it was able to make a lasting contribution. This\nshift in perspective also helped to clarify the models\u2019 scope, in terms of\nwhat questions they should be expected to answer, and identified shortcomings\nthat in turn spurred further research.\n\n>\n\n> There are of course numerous perspectives on the historical and current\ncontributions of connectionism, and it is not the purpose of the present\narticle to debate these views. Instead, we merely summarize two points in the\nhistory of connectionism that illustrate how overemphasis on computational\npower at the expense of theoretical development can delay scientific progress.\n\n>\n\n> Early work on artificial neurons by McCulloch and Pitts (1943) and synaptic\nlearning rules by Hebb (1949) showed how simple, neuron-like units could\nautomatically learn various prediction tasks. This new framework seemed very\npromising as a source of explanations for autonomous, intelligent behavior. A\nrush of research followed, culminated by Rosenblatt\u2019s (1962) perceptron model,\nfor which he boldly claimed, \u201cGiven an elementary a-perceptron, a stimulus\nworld W, and any classification C(W) for which a solution exists, . . . an\nerror correction procedure will always yield a solution to C(W) in finite\ntime\u201d (p. 111). However, Minsky and Papert (1969) pointed out a fatal flaw:\nPerceptrons are provably unable to solve problems requiring nonlinear\nsolutions. This straightforward yet unanticipated critique devastated the\nconnectionist movement such that there was little research under that\nframework for the ensuing 15 years.\n\n>\n\n> Connectionism underwent a revival in themid-1980s, primarily triggered by\nthe development of back-propagation, a learning algorithm that could be used\nin multilayer networks (Rumelhart et al. 1986). This advance dramatically\nexpanded the representational capacity of connectionist models, to the point\nwhere they were capable of approximating any function to arbitrary precision,\nbolstering hopes that paired with powerful learning rules any task could be\nlearnable (Hornik et al. 1989). This technical advance led to a flood of new\nwork, as researchers sought to show that neural networks could reproduce the\ngamut of psychological phenomena, from perception to decision making to\nlanguage processing (e.g., McClelland et al. 1986; Rumelhart et al. 1986).\nUnfortunately, the bubble was to burst once again, following a series of\nattacks on connectionism\u2019s representational capabilities and lack of\ngrounding. Connectionist models were criticized for being incapable of\ncapturing the compositionality and productivity characteristic of language\nprocessing and other cognitive representations (Fodor &amp; Pylyshyn 1988);\nfor being too opaque (e.g., in the distribution and dynamics of their weights)\nto offer insight into their own operation, much less that of the brain\n(Smolensky 1988); and for using learning rules that are biologically\nimplausible and amount to little more than a generalized regression (Crick\n1989). The theoretical position underlying connectionism was thus reduced to\nthe vague claim that that the brain can learn through feedback to predict its\nenvironment, without a psychological explanation being offered of how it does\nso. As before, once the excitement over computational power was tempered, the\nshortage of theoretical substance was exposed.\n\n>\n\n> One reason that research in connectionism suffered such setbacks is that,\nalthough there were undeniably important theoretical contributions made during\nthis time, overall there was insufficient critical evaluation of the nature\nand validity of the psychological claims underlying the approach. During the\ninitial explosions of connectionist research, not enough effort was spent\nasking what it would mean for the brain to be fundamentally governed by\ndistributed representations and tuning of association strengths, or which\npossible specific assumptions within this framework were most consistent with\nthe data. Consequently, when the limitations of the metaphor were brought to\nlight, the field was not prepared with an adequate answer. On the other hand,\npointing out the shortcomings of the approach (e.g., Marcus 1998; Pinker &amp;\nPrince 1988) was productive in the long run, because it focused research on\nthe hard problems. Over the last two decades, attempts to answer these\ncriticisms have led to numerous innovative approaches to computational\nproblems such as object binding (Hummel &amp; Biederman 1992), structured\nrepresentation (Pollack 1990), recurrent dynamics (Elman 1990), and executive\ncontrol (e.g., Miller &amp; Cohen 2001; Rougier et al. 2005). At the same\ntime, integration with knowledge of anatomy and physiology has led to much\nmore biologically realistic networks capable of predicting neurological,\npharmacological, and lesion data (e.g., Boucher et al. 2007; Frank et al.\n2004).

A scientist of the period, Francesco Lana, contended that a\nlighter-than-air ship could float upon this sea, and he suggested how such a\nship might be built. He was unable to put his invention to a practical test,\nbut he saw only one reason why it might not work:\n\n>\n\n> \". . . that God will never suffer this Invention to take effect, because of\nthe many consequencies which may disturb the Civil Government of men. For who\nsees not, that no City can be secure against attack, since our Ship may at any\ntime be placed directly over it, and descending down may discharge Souldiers;\nthe same would happen to private Houses, and Ships on the Sea: for our Ship\ndescending out of the Air to the sails of Sea-Ships, it may cut their Ropes,\nyea without descending by casting Grapples it may over-set them, kill their\nmen, burn their Ships by artificial Fire works and Fire-balls. And this they\nmay do not only to Ships but to great Buildings, Castles, Cities, with such\nsecurity that they which cast these things down from a height out of Gun-shot,\ncannot on the other side be offended by those below.\"\n\n>\n\n> Lana's reservation was groundless.

One of the things he'd come\nto learn since the Ring of Fire, all the way down to the marrow of his bones,\nwas that if the ancestors of twentieth-century human beings didn't do\nsomething that seemed logical, it was probably because it wasn't actually\nlogical at all, once you understood everything involved. So it turned out that\nsuch notorious military numbskulls as Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, Phil\nSheridan, Stonewall Jackson, William Tecumseh Sherman and all the rest of them\nhadn't actually been idiots after all. It was easy for twentieth-century\nprofessors to proclaim loftily that Civil War generals had insisted on\ncontinuing with line formations despite the advent of the Mini\u00e9 ball-armed\nrifled musket because the dimwits simply hadn't noticed that the guns were\naccurate for several hundred yards. When\u2014cluck; cluck\u2014they should obviously\nhave adopted the skirmishing tactics of twentieth-century infantry.\n\n>\n\n> But it turned out, when put to a ruthless seventeenth-century Swedish\ngeneral's test in his very rigorous notion of field exercises, that those\nprofessors of a later era had apparently never tried to stand their ground\nwhen cavalry came at them. After they fired their shot, and needed one-third\nof a minute\u2014if they were adept at the business, and didn't get rattled\u2014to have\na second shot ready. In that bloody world where real soldiers lived and died,\nskirmishing tactics without breechloading rifles or automatic weapons were\njust a way to commit suicide. If the opponent had large enough forces and was\nwilling to lose some men, at least.\n\n\\-- 1634: The Baltic War, by Eric Flint and David Weber\n\n",

        "markdown": "A classic illustration of how to use (and how to not use) conditional\nprobabilities:\n\n> \"'Her foot,' says the journal, 'was small- so are thousands of feet. Her\ngarter is no proof whatever- nor is her shoe- for shoes and garters are sold\nin packages. The same may be said of the flowers in her hat. One thing upon\nwhich M. Beauvais strongly insists is, that the clasp on the garter found had\nbeen set back to take it in. This amounts to nothing; for most women find it\nproper to take a pair of garters home and, fit them to the size of the limbs\nthey are to encircle, rather than to try them in the store where they\npurchase.'\n\n>\n\n> Here it is difficult to suppose the reasoner in earnest. Had M. Beauvais, in\nhis search for the body of Marie, discovered a corpse corresponding in general\nsize and appearance to the missing girl, he would have been warranted (without\nreference to the question of _ habiliment _ at all) in forming an opinion that\nhis search had been successful. If, in addition to the point of general size\nand contour, he had found upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he\nhad observed upon the living Marie, his opinion might have been justly\nstrengthened; and the increase of positiveness might well have been in the\nratio of the peculiarity, or unusualness, of the hairy mark. If, the feet of\nMarie being small, those of the corpse were also small, the increase of\nprobability that the body was that of Marie would not be an increase in a\nratio merely arithmetical, but in one highly geometrical, or accumulative. Add\nto all this shoes such as she had been known to wear upon the day of her\ndisappearance, and, although these shoes may be 'sold in packages,' you so far\naugment the probability as to verge upon the certain. What, of itself, would\nbe no evidence of identity, becomes through its corroborative position, proof\nmost sure. Give us, then, flowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by\nthe missing girl, and we seek for nothing farther. If only one flower, we seek\nfor nothing farther- what then if two or three, or more? Each successive one\nis multiple evidence- proof not added to proof, but multiplied by hundreds or\nthousands. Let us now discover, upon the deceased, garters such as the living\nused, and it is almost folly to proceed. But these garters are found to be\ntightened, by the setting back of a clasp, in just such a manner as her own\nhad been tightened by Marie shortly previous to her leaving home. It is now\nmadness or hypocrisy to doubt. \u2026 But it is not that the corpse was found to\nhave the garters of the missing girl, or found to have her shoes, or her\nbonnet, or the flowers of her bonnet, or her feet, or a peculiar mark upon the\narm, or her general size and appearance- it is that the corpse had each and\nall collectively.\n\n\\--Edgar Allan Poe, \"The Mystery of Marie Roget\"\n\n",

Full\nof interest and anticipation, Kyra peered into the physician's face. \"All\nright then,\" he said, \"if you so desire. I would tell the Almighty: 'Great\nCreator, I do not know your plan; maybe it's simply not your intention to make\nmankind good and happy. Nevertheless, I beg you: let it happen--it would be so\neasy for you to accomplish--that all men have sufficient bread, meat, and\nwine! Provide them with shelter and clothing, let hunger and want disappear\nfrom the face of the earth, and all that separates men from each other.\" 'That\nwould be all?\" asked Rumata. \"Does it seem too little to you?\" Rumata shook\nhis head slowly from side to side. \"God would answer you: This would be no\nblessing for mankind. For the strong of your world take away from the weak\nwhatever I gave them and the weak would be as poor as before.\" \"I would beg\nGod to protect the poor. \"Enlighten the cruel rulers,' I would say.\" \"Cruelty\nis a mighty force. Once the rulers rid themselves of their cruel ways they\nwould lose their power. And other cruel men would take their place.\" Budach's\nfriendly face grew suddenly somber. \"Then punish the cruel men,\" he said with\ndetermination, \"and lead them away from the path of evil, so that the strong\nmay not be cruel to their weaker brothers.\" \"It is man's nature to be weak\nfrom the moment he is born. He will only grow strong when there is no one\nstronger than he is. And if the cruel ones among the strong are punished and\nremoved from their ranks, they will simply be replaced by the relatively\nstronger ones from among the throng of the weak. And the newly strong ones\nwill become cruel in their turn. That would mean that eventually all men would\nhave to be punished, and this I do not want to do.\" \"You have greater insight,\nAlmighty Lord. Therefore arrange that mankind will obtain all they need and\nthus avoid that they will rob each other of whatever you gave them.\" 'This\nsolution wouldn't be a blessing for mankind either,\" sighed Rumata. \"They\nwould not reap profit from this. For if they obtain everything from my hand\nwithout any effort on their part, they will forget what it is to work and\nlabor; they will lose their taste for living. As time goes on they'll become\ndomestic animals whom I will have to feed and clothe--and that for all\neternity.\" \"Don't give them everything at once!\" said Budach excitedly. \"Give\nit to them slowly, gradually!\" \"Gradually mankind will take everything they\nneed anyhow.\" Budach's smile became embarrassed. \"Now I can see that things\nare not quite so simple,\" he said. \"I've never really thought about the\nproblems ... I believe we have discussed all possibilities now. However,\" he\nleaned forward, \"there exists still another possibility: Ordain that mankind\nwill love work and knowledge above all, that work and wisdom will be regarded\nby them as their sole reason for being!\" Yes, thought Rumata, we've already\nconsidered such experiments. Mass hypno-induction, positive remoralization,\nexposure to hypnotic radiation from three equatorial satellites ... This is an\nalternative I might choose perhaps,\" he said. \"But could it be justified if I\nwere to rob mankind of its history? Does it make sense to replace one type of\nman with another? Would this not mean in the end that one would wipe this\nmankind off the face of the earth and create another in its place?\" Budach\nfrowned and remained silent, busy with his own thoughts. From below the\nwindows came again the melancholy groaning of heavily laden carts. Suddenly\nBudach spoke softly: \"Then, oh, Lord, remove us from the face of the earth and\ncreate us anew, make us better men this time, more perfect beings. Or, better\nstill--leave us the way we are, but ordain that we can follow our own path!\"\n\"My heart is heavy with sorrow,\" Rumata said slowly, \"but this is not within\nmy power.\"\n\nArkady and Boris Strugatsky, Hard to be a God\n\n",

If the teenager went back to 1910, he or she\nwould have had an IQ of 130, besting 98 percent of his or her contemporaries.\nYes, you read that right: if we take the Flynn Effect at face value, a typical\nperson today is smarter than 98 percent of the people in the good old days of\n1910. To state it in an even more jarring way, a typical person of 1910, if\ntime-transported forward to the present, would have a mean IQ of 70, which is\nat the border of mental retardation. With the Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices, a\ntest that is sometimes considered the purest measure of general intelligence,\nthe rise is even steeper. An ordinary person of 1910 would have an IQ of 50\ntoday, which is smack in the middle of mentally retarded territory, between\n\u201cmoderate\u201d and \u201cmild\u201d retardation.\n\n-S.

But studies show that less than 10 percent of the\nreason why people reach agreement has anything to do with the substance. More\nthan 50 percent has to do with the people\u2014do they like each other, do they\ntrust each other, will they hear what each other has to say? Just over a third\nhas to do with the process they use. That is, do they decide to explore each\nother\u2019s needs (rational and emotional)? Do they agree on an agenda? Do they\nmake genuine commitments to each other?\n\n>\n\n> If you believe that negotiations are about the substantive issues, sadly,\nyou will be right more than you are persuasive. That means that the truth, the\nfacts, are only one argument in a negotiation. The people and the process are\nmuch more important. This is particularly hard for people who are focused on\nthe substance\u2014doctors, engineers, financial experts\u2014to accept. But, based on\nresearch, it is true. You can\u2019t even use substantive issues to persuade\neffectively unless and until the other party is ready to hear about them.\n\n\\--Stuart Diamond, Getting More, 2010, pp. 51-52\n\n",

The expert real estate\nsalesman wants to sell your house quickly, with as little marketing expense as\npossible, and he doesn't care if you get the best price or not.

That \u201claw\u201d is now found to be incorrect. Mass is found to increase\nwith velocity, but appreciable increases require velocities near that of\nlight. A _ true _ law is: if an object moves with a speed of less than one\nhundred miles a second the mass is constant to within one part in a million.\nIn some such approximate form this is a correct law. So in practice one might\nthink that the new law makes no significant difference. Well, yes and no. For\nordinary speeds we can certainly forget it and use the simple constant-mass\nlaw as a good approximation. But for high speeds we are wrong, and the higher\nthe speed, the more wrong we are.\n\n>\n\n> Finally, and most interesting, _ philosophically we are completely wrong _\nwith the approximate law. Our entire picture of the world has to be altered\neven though the mass changes only by a little bit. This is a very peculiar\nthing about the philosophy, or the ideas, behind the laws.

The problem facing them has much the same logic as a scientific\nproblem. Although in nature there is no conjurer trying to deceive us\nintentionally, we can be mystified in both cases for essentially the same\nreason: appearances are not self-explanatory. If the explanation of a\nconjuring trick were evident in its appearance, there would be no trick. If\nthe explanations of physical phenomena were evident in their appearance,\nempiricism would be true and there would be no need for science as we know it.\nThe problem is not to predict the trick's appearance. I may, for instance\npredict that if a conjurer seems to place various balls under various cups,\nthose cups will later appear to be empty; and I may predict that if the\nconjurer appears to saw someone in half, that person will later appear on\nstage unharmed. Those are testable predictions. I may experience many\nconjuring shows and see my predictions vindicated every time. But that does\nnot even address, let alone solve, the problem of how the trick works. Solving\nit requires an explanation: a statement of the reality which accounts for the\ntrick's appearance.\n\nDavid Deutsch, _ The Beginning of Infinity _\n\n",

So I am easily panicked in my science and I\nthink thus I can easily imagine more readily than most people in my position\nhow somebody else can be. I think sort of pedagogically where that came about:\nduring grad school I wound up in a grad school that didn\u2019t have an\nundergraduate college\u2014it was just a research institute\u2014so we didn't have to do\nthe TAing stuff that grad students do here, and thought that was probably a\nbad thing sort of professionally, so I figured out a way to sneak off and\nmoonlight, I was in New York at a place called The New School for Social\nResearch, where they kind of hired me to moonlight on the side, and it like\ntotally violated my fellowship and I had to like sneak off out the back way\nfrom my university and stuff. And right around time there was this fashion\ninstitute in New York called Parsons School of Design that had just lost their\nacademic accreditation\u2014which it turned out to be, like, decades after that\nprobably should have happened\u2014and they decided, they went out and like shut\nout all their tenured non-design faculty and they forced their students to go\nover to The New School to take their courses. And there was a science\nrequirement and I was like offered one of the two science courses at the New\nSchool, so I would get these classes full of these unbelievably hostile,\nphobic, teeny-bopper textile designers, and this forced an enormous pressure\nto be clear, and to have a good sense as to when people are about to go\nberserk with too many terms and stuff and like when you have to stop and give\nan anecdote or metaphor or something, so I think in retrospect it was actually\nvery good training.

It is useful if you want to be the first on your block\nto know that the shift has taken place. I formulated the rule in 1974. I was\nvisiting the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) for a weeks to give a\ncouple of seminars on particle physics. The subject was QCD. It doesn't matter\nwhat this stands for. The point is that it was a new theory of sub-nuclear\nparticles and it was absolutely clear that it was the right theory. There was\nno critical experiment but the place was littered with smoking guns. Anyway,\nat the end of my first lecture I took a poll of the audience. \"What\nprobability would you assign to the proposition 'QCD is the right theory of\nhadrons.'?\" My socks were knocked off by the answers. They ranged from .01\npercent to 5 percent. As I said, by this time it was a clear no-brainer. The\nanswer should have been close to 100 percent. The next day I gave my second\nseminar and took another poll. \"What are you working on?\" was the question.\nAnswers: QCD, QCD, QCD, QCD, QCD,........ Everyone was working on QCD. That's\nwhen I learned to ask \"What are you doing?\" instead of \"what do you think?\"\n\n>\n\n> I saw exactly the same phenomenon more recently when I was working on black\nholes. This time it was after a string theory seminar, I think in Santa\nBarbara. I asked the audience to vote whether they agreed with me and Gerard\n't Hooft or if they thought Hawking\u2019s ideas were correct. This time I got a\n50-50 response. By this time I knew what was going on so I wasn't so\nsurprised. Anyway I later asked if anyone was working on Hawking's theory of\ninformation loss. Not a single hand went up. Don't ask what they think. Ask\nwhat they do.\n\n-Leonard Susskind, [ Susskind's Rule of Thumb ](http://edge.org/response-detail/10417)\n\n",

The problem is that these same biased processes can influence how we\nexperience other aspects of our world. These biased processes are in fact a\nmajor source of escalation in almost every conflict, whether Israeli-\nPalestinian, American-Iraqi, Serbian-Croatian, or Indian-Pakistani.\n\n>\n\n> In all these conflicts, individuals from both sides can read similar history\nbooks and even have the same facts taught to them, yet it is very unusual to\nfind individuals who would agree about who started the conflict, who is to\nblame, who should make the next concession, etc. In such matters, our\ninvestment in our beliefs is much stronger than any affiliation to sport\nteams, and so we hold on to these beliefs tenaciously. Thus the likelihood of\nagreement about \u201cthe facts\u201d becomes smaller and smaller as personal investment\nin the problem grows. This is clearly disturbing. We like to think that\nsitting at the same table together will help us hammer out our differences and\nthat concessions will soon follow.

First, he said, science had certain rules. For example, ** it\nhas to assume that the phenomena it is observing is natural in origin rather\nthan artificial and possibly biased. ** Now the UFO phenomenon could be\ncontrolled by alien beings. \u201cIf it is,\u201d added the Major, ** \u201cthen the study of\nit doesn\u2019t belong to science. It belongs to Intelligence.\u201d ** Meaning\ncounterespionage. And that, he pointed out, was his domain. *\n\n\u201cNow, in the field of counterespionage, the rules are completely different.\u201d\nHe drew a simple diagram in my notebook. ** \u201cYou are a scientist. In science\nthere is no concept of the \u2018price\u2019 of information. Suppose I gave you 95 per\ncent of the data concerning a phenomenon. You\u2019re happy because you know 95 per\ncent of the phenomenon. Not so in intelligence. If I get 95 per cent of the\ndata, I know that this is the \u2018cheap\u2019 part of the information. I still need\nthe other 5 percent, but I will have to pay a much higher price to get it. **\nYou see, Hitler had 95 per cent of the information about the landing in\nNormandy. But he had the wrong 95 percent!\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying that the UFO data we us to compile statistics and to find\npatterns with computers are useless?\u201d I asked. \u201cMight we be spinning our\nmagnetic tapes endlessly discovering spurious laws?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt all depends on how the team on the other side thinks. If they know what\nthey\u2019re doing, there will be so many cutouts between you and them that you\nwon\u2019t have the slightest chance of tracing your way to the truth. Not by\nfollowing up sightings and throwing them into a computer. They will keep\nfeeding you the information they want you to process. What is the only source\nof data about the UFO phenomenon? It is the UFOs themselves!\u201d\n\nSome things were beginning to make a lot of sense. \u201cIf you\u2019re right, what can\nI do? It seems that research on the phenomenon is hopeless, then. I might as\nwell dump my computer into a river.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot necessarily, but you should try a different approach. First you should\nwork entirely outside of the organized UFO groups; they are infiltrated by the\nsame official agencies they are trying to influence, and they propagate any\nrumour anyone wants to have circulated. In Intelligence circles, people like\nthat are historical necessities. We call them \u2018useful idiots\u2019. When you\u2019ve\nworked long enough for Uncle Sam, you know he is involved in a lot of strange\nthings. The data these groups get is biased at the source, but they play a\nuseful role.\n\n** \u201cSecond, you should look for the irrational, the bizarre, the elements that do not fit...Have you ever felt that you were getting close to something that didn\u2019t seem to fit any rational pattern yet gave you a strong impression that it was significant?\u201d' **\n\n",

That is what we\u2019ve all experienced\nwhen we\u2019ve wanted to do good. Something changes the more we just give hand-out\nafter hand-out. Something that is designed to be a help actually causes harm.\n\n[ Peter Greer ](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jerrybowyer/2013/07/30/your-help-\nis-hurting-how-church-foreign-aid-programs-make-things-worse/)\n\n",

And\nwhat's more, he would make a great big batch of it at the start of every week,\nand put it in a drawer, and when he wanted a meal he would slice off a piece\nand eat it cold; thus he saved on firewood. Now, by the end of the week, the\noatmeal would be somewhat moldy and not very appetising; and so to make\nhimself eat it, the miser would take out a bottle of good whiskey, and pour\nhimself a glass, and say \"All right, Olai, eat your oatmeal and when you're\ndone, you can have a dram.\" Then he would eat his moldy oatmeal, and when he\nwas done he'd laugh and pour the whiskey back in the bottle, and say \"Hah!

If a husband thinks a marital debate is about\nleaving the toliet seat up or not, and the wife thinks it is about why her\nhusband never listens to, appreciates or loves her the way he should, expect\nfireworks and frustration. If you are in an argument that you think is about\ngovernment debt and it\u2019s going nowhere, it may be because the person you are\ndebating isn\u2019t really arguing about the current level of government debt.\nRather, they are arguing about the size of government.\n\n>\n\n> If you get into a debate that is ostensibly about the level of government\ndebt, try the following tactic (or try it on yourself in your own mind): If\nyour opponent says that government debt is too high and we therefore need to\ncut public spending, ask whether s/he has EVER favored under ANY economic\nconditions a nice, fat increase in public spending. If you are debating\nsomeone who says that government debt is no big deal and that we should be\nincreasing public spending, ask if s/he has EVER favored under ANY economics\nconditions a big, fat cut in public spending.

        "markdown": "> [O]ur moral judgments are less reliable than many would hope, and this has\nspecific implications for methodology in normative ethics. Three sources of\nevidence indicate that our intuitive ethical judgments are less reliable than\nwe might have hoped: a historical record of accepting morally absurd social\npractices; a scientic record showing that our intuitive judgments are\nsystematically governed by a host of heuristics, biases, and irrelevant\nfactors; and a philosophical record showing deep, probably unresolvable,\ninconsistencies in common moral convictions. I argue that this has the\nfollowing implications for moral theorizing: we should trust intuitions less;\nwe should be especially suspicious of intuitive judgments that t a bias\npattern, even when we are intuitively condent that these judgments are not a\nsimple product of the bias; we should be especially suspicious of intuitions\nthat are part of inconsistent sets of deeply held convictions; and we should\nevaluate views holistically, thinking of entire classes of judgments that they\nget right or wrong in broad contexts, rather than dismissing positions on the\nbasis of a small number of intuitive counterexamples.\n\nNick Beckstead, _ On the Overwhelming Importance of Shaping the Far Future _ ,\nUniversity of Rutgers, New Brunswick, 2013, p. 19\n\n",

Imagine that you\nare a Kalahari Bushman and that you stumble upon a transistor radio in the\nsand. You might pick it up, twiddle the knobs, and suddenly, to your surprise,\nhear voices streaming out of this strange little box. If you\u2019re curious and\nscientifically minded, you might try to understand what is going on. You might\npry off the back cover to discover a little nest of wires. Now let\u2019s say you\nbegin a careful, scientific study of what causes the voices. You notice that\neach time you pull out the green wire, the voices stop. When you put the wire\nback on its contact, the voices begin again. The same goes for the red wire.\nYanking out the black wire causes the voices to get garbled, and removing the\nyellow wire reduces the volume to a whisper. You step carefully through all\nthe combinations, and you come to a clear conclusion: the voices depend\nentirely on the integrity of the circuitry. Change the circuitry and you\ndamage the voices.\n\n>\n\n> Proud of your new discoveries, you devote your life to developing a science\nof the way in which certain configurations of wires create the existence of\nmagical voices. At some point, a young person asks you how some simple loops\nof electrical signals can engender music and conversations, and you admit that\nyou don\u2019t know\u2014but you insist that your science is about to crack that problem\nat any moment.\n\n>\n\n> Your conclusions are limited by the fact that you know absolutely nothing\nabout radio waves and, more generally, electromagnetic radiation. The fact\nthat there are structures in distant cities called radio towers\u2014which send\nsignals by perturbing invisible waves that travel at the speed of light\u2014is so\nforeign to you that you could not even dream it up. You can\u2019t taste radio\nwaves, you can\u2019t see them, you can\u2019t smell them, and you don\u2019t yet have any\npressing reason to be creative enough to fantasize about them. And if you did\ndream of invisible radio waves that carry voices, who could you convince of\nyour hypothesis? You have no technology to demonstrate the existence of the\nwaves, and everyone justifiably points out that the onus is on you to convince\nthem.\n\n>\n\n> So you would become a radio materialist. You would conclude that somehow the\nright configuration of wires engenders classical music and intelligent\nconversation. You would not realize that you\u2019re missing an enormous piece of\nthe puzzle.\n\n>\n\n> I\u2019m not asserting that the brain is like a radio\u2014that is, that we\u2019re\nreceptacles picking up signals from elsewhere, and that our neural circuitry\nneeds to be in place to do so\u2014but I am pointing out that it _ could _ be true.\nThere is nothing in our current science that rules this out. Knowing as little\nas we do at this point in history, we must retain concepts like this in the\nlarge filing cabinet of ideas that we cannot yet rule in favor of or against.\nSo even though few working scientists will design experiments around eccentric\nhypotheses, ideas always need to be proposed and nurtured as possibilities\nuntil evidence weighs in one way or another.\n\n\\--David Eagleman, _ Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain _ , Random\nHouse, pp. 221-222\n\n",

She was curious as to whether, if she\nchanged the circumstances to Y, they would still do A. So her proposal was to\ndo the experiment under circumstances Y and see if they still did A.\n\n>\n\n> I explained to her that it was necessary first to repeat in her laboratory\nthe experiment of the other person -- to do it under condition X to see if she\ncould also get result A, and then change to Y and see if A changed. Then she\nwould know that the real difference was the thing she thought she had under\ncontrol.\n\n>\n\n> She was very delighted with this new idea, and went to her professor. And\nhis reply was, no, you cannot do that, because the experiment has already been\ndone and you would be wasting time.

This is nowhere more apparent than in the game of backgammon. A good\nopponent will play in such a way that the dice rolls having highest\nprobability will be \"good rolls\" for them on their next turn, enabling them to\ntake the other player's pieces, consolidate their position, etc. However,\nsince there is an element of randomness, when these rolls actually come up it\nis very difficult even for me to believe that my opponent's fortune is due to\ntheir skill rather than their luck. Whenever I am being consistently beaten by\nan opponent I have to fight very hard to make myself believe that there is\nactually something wrong with my play and figure out how to correct it.\n\n>\n\n> This phenomenon is nowhere more apparent than in computer backgammon.\nComputer backgammon is essentially a solved problem. Unlike Chess or Go, the\nbest neural network algorithms that run even on modest hardware will\nconsistently beat most human players, and perhaps draw with the best in the\nworld. In fact, we have learnt rather a lot from these algorithms. Many rules\nof thumb that were believed for years by most decent players have been\noverturned by computer simulations. Computers tend to play backgammon markedly\nmore aggressively than is natural for a human, but we can show that they are\nnevertheless doing the right thing. If you are not an extremely high level\nplayer, playing against a good computer algorithm feels weird if you are used\nto playing against humans.\n\n>\n\n> One of the most annoying results of this is that it is impossible to obtain\na reliable user generated rating of a backgammon program. For example, GNU\nBackgammon is one of the two or three best algorithms in the world and an\nunder-appreciated gem of the GNU project as a whole. A full 50% of the user\nreviews on the Ubuntu software centre accuse the program of cheating by fixing\nthe dice rolls and give it a 1 or 2 star review. It is hilarious how many of\nthese reviews include comments like they \"know how to play\" or have been\n\"playing for a long time\" as if this were evidence to support their claim. The\nrest of the reviews are by people who know better and they all give it 4 or 5\nstars (4 is reasonable due to a few user interface quirks, but the algorithm\nitself is worth a 5). As a result, the averaged rating is only 3 stars, even\nthough this is widely acknowledged as one of the three best backgammon\nprograms in the world. It doesn't cheat because it doesn't have to, and it\nactually gives you mechanisms for checking that it is not cheating, e.g.\nentering dice rolls manually and a tutor mode that will correct your bad\nplays.\n\n>\n\n> This phenomenon is repeated absolutely everywhere that user reviews of\nbackgammon programs are available. On the Google Play store, I have seen this\neven on a program with an absolutely crappy algorithm that I can consistently\nbeat on expert level as well as on decent ones that are backed by GNUbg. As a\nresult, it is absolutely impossible to find out which are the good backgammon\nprograms if you don't already know, since they all get a low average rating.\n\n\\-- [ Matthew Leifer\n](https://plus.google.com/116973436260300431929/posts/RXCVL6PgTkp)\n\n",

A speech, an appeal to reason: there is nothing here about lucrative\ncontracts for political supporters, promises of sinecure jobs for politicians\nwho lose their seats, a \u201cblank check\u201d for administrative backing on some\nobscure tax loophole that a particular politician could award to a favored\nclient; there\u2019s not even a delicate hint about grand jury investigations that\ncan be stopped in their tracks or compromising photographs or wiretaps that\nneed never see the light of day. Far be it from Ms Dowd to speak of or even\nhint at the kind of strategy that actual politicians think about when words\nlike \u2018hardball\u2019 come to mind.

One little piece of information,\nor an unsubstantiated report, can grow and become magnified, quickly becoming\nan unquestioned truism. She used as an example the truism that the extracts of\nthe herb Ginkgo Biloba might cause dangerous bleeding. Everyone says it can.\nThe journalists say it. The doctors say it. The herbalists say it. Even I say\nit! It's nearly impossible to read a scientific paper on Ginkgo that doesn't\nmention this alleged danger. But why do we say it - where did the information\ncome from? Turns out, there was one case report - of a single person - who\ncouldn't clot efficiently after taking Ginkgo. Another 178 papers were\npublished that mentioned this danger, citing only this one report. Those 178\npapers were cited by over 4,100 other papers. So now we have almost 4-and-a-\nhalf thousand references in the scientific literature - not to mention the\ntens of thousands of references in the popular press - to the dangers of\nGinkgo, all traceable back to a single person whose bleeding may or may not\nhave been attributable to the herb.\n\n\\- [ Adam Stark ](http://debrasnaturalgourmet.com/herbal-moments-at-expo-west)\n\n",

The classic example is John\nSnow's demonstration that the 1854 cholera epidemic in London was attributable\nto contaminants in the water. When he removed the handle from the Broad Street\npump, the number of cases in the area served by that pump promptly began to\nwane. Exactly what was in the water that caused the cholera would not be\ndemonstrated for more than a quarter of a century. Still the results of Snow's\nintervention were so dramatic that no one questioned the cause-and-effect\nrelationship _ even in the absence of an explicit hypothesis _ . However, when\nthe causal linkage is less obvious, the absence of a plausible hypothesis can\nbe a significant deterrent to action.\n\n>\n\n> To return to the case at hand, it was difficult for several reasons for\nphysicians to accept the idea that the concentration of blood cholesterol\ncould be a major factor in determining the chances of myocardial infarction\ndecades down the road. As discussed in Chapter 3, it was not appreciated that\nthe _ average _ blood cholesterol level in the United States, the so-called _\nnormal _ level, was actually _ abnormal _ . It was accelerating atherogenesis\nand putting a large fraction of the so-called normal population at a high risk\nfor coronary heart diseases. Also, very little was known about the structure\nand metabolism of these recently discovered and still mysterious cholesterol-\nprotein complexes -- the serum lipoproteins -- and almost nothing was known\nabout how they got into the vessel wall and contributed to the development of\nthe lesions. A degree of skepticism was understandable.\n\n\\--Daniel Steinberg, [ The Cholesterol Wars\n](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0123739799/ref=nosim/cafeaulaitA) ,\n2007, Elsevier Press, p. 89\n\n",

The losses to the firm and the adviser if he recommends the rejection of\nthe invention are both negligible...\n\n>\n\n> Then the firm's expected gain if the invention is adopted is pV - (1-p)L and\nthe adviser's expected gain in the same circumstances is pv - (1-p)l. The firm\nhas positive expected gain if p/(1-p) &gt; L/V, and the adviser has positive\nexpected gain if p/(1-p) &gt; l/v.\n\n>\n\n> If l/v &gt; p/(1-p) &gt; L/V, the adviser will be faced with an ethical\nproblem, i.e. he will be tempted to act against the interests of the firm.\n\nThis is a beautifully simple recipe for a conflict of interest:\n\nConsidering absolute losses assuming failure and absolute gains conditioned on\nsuccess, an adviser is incentivized to give the wrong advice, precisely when:\n\n  * The ratio of agent loss to agent gain, \n  * exceeds the odds of success versus failure \n  * which in turn exceeds the ratio of principal loss to principal gain. \n\nYou can see this reflected in a _ lot _ of cases because the gains to an\nadvisor often don't scale anywhere near as fast as the gains to society or a\nfirm. It's the Fearful Committee Formula.\n\n",

When the trolley was in motion, air flowing over its top would\nspin the fans, pulling warm air out of the cars. One student noticed that\nalthough the motion of any given fan was fairly random\u2014fans could turn either\nclockwise or counterclockwise\u2014the two fans in a single car nearly always\nrotated in opposite directions. Why was this? Finally he brought the problem\nto Sommerfeld.\n\n>\n\n> \u201cThat is easy to explain,\u201d said Sommerfeld. \u201cAir hits the fan at the front\nof the car first, giving it a random motion in one direction. But once the\ntrolley begins to move, a vortex created by the first fan travels down the top\nof the car and sets the second fan moving in precisely the same direction.\u201d\n\n>\n\n> \u201cBut, Professor Sommerfeld,\u201d the student protested, \u201cwhat happens is in fact\nthe opposite!

One may be forgiven for not being\ntoo happy about any division of mankind into good and evil, progressive and\nreactionary, black and white; and it is not clear that moral indignation is\nnot a dispersion of one\u2019s energies to the great confusion of one\u2019s judgement.\nThere can be no complaint against the historian who personally and privately\nhas his preferences and antipathies, and who as a human being merely has a\nfancy to take part in the game that he is describing; it is pleasant to see\nhim give way to his prejudices and take them emotionally, so that they splash\ninto colour as he writes; provided that when he steps in this way into the\narena he recognizes that he is stepping into a world of partial judgements and\npurely personal appreciations and does not imagines that he is speaking ex\ncathedra.\n\n>\n\n> But if the historian can rear himself up like a god and judge, or stand as\nthe official avenger of the crimes of the past, then one can require that he\nshall be still more godlike and regard himself rather as the reconciler than\nas the avenger; taking it that his aim is to achieve the understanding of the\nmen and parties and causes of the past, and that in this understanding, if it\ncan be complete, all things will ultimately be reconciled. It seems to be\nassumed that in history we can have something more than the private points of\nview of particular historian; that there are \u201cverdicts of history\u201d and that\nhistory itself, considered impersonally, has something to say to men. It seems\nto be accepted that each historian does something more than make a confession\nof his private mind and his whimsicalities, and that all of them are trying to\nelicit a truth, and perhaps combining through their various imperfections to\nexpress a truth, which, if we could perfectly attain it, would be the voice of\nHistory itself.\n\n>\n\n> But if history is in this way something like the memory of mankind and\nrepresents the spirit of man brooding over man\u2019s past, we must imagine it as\nworking not to accentuate antagonisms or to ratify old party-cries but to find\nthe unities that underlie the differences and to see all lives as part of the\none web of life. The historian trying to feel his way towards this may be\nstriving to be like a god but perhaps he is less foolish than the one who\nposes as god the avenger. Studying the quarrels of an ancient day he can at\nleast seek to understand both parties to the struggle and he must want to\nunderstand them better than they understood themselves; watching them\nentangled in the net of time and circumstance he can take pity on them \u2013 these\nmen who perhaps had no pity for one another; and, though he can never be\nperfect, it is difficult to see why he should aspire to anything less than\ntaking these men and their quarrels into a world where everything is\nunderstood and all sins are forgiven.\n\n\u2014 Herbert Butterfield, _ The Whig Interpretation of History _\n\n",

I used to ask how on Earth it can be a\nvirtue \u2013 what is there moral or immoral about believing or not believing a set\nof statements? Obviously, I used to say, a sane man accepts or rejects any\nstatement, not because he wants or does not want to, but because the evidence\nseems to him good or bad. If he were mistaken about the goodness or badness of\nthe evidence, that would not mean he was a bad man, but only that he was not\nvery clever. And if he thought the evidence bad but tried to force himself to\nbelieve in spite of it, that would be merely stupid\u2026\n\n>\n\n> What I did not see then \u2013 and a good many people do not see still \u2013 was\nthis. I was assuming that if the human mind once accepts a thing as true it\nwill automatically go on regarding it as true, until some real reason for\nreconsidering it turns up. In fact, I was assuming that the human mind is\ncompletely ruled by reason. But that is not so. For example, my reason is\nperfectly convinced by good evidence that anesthetics do not smother me and\nthat properly trained surgeons do not start operating until I am unconscious.\nBut that does not alter the fact that when they have me down on the table and\nclap their horrible mask over my face, a mere childish panic begins inside me.\nI start thinking I am going to choke, and I am afraid they will start cutting\nme up before I am properly under. In other words, I lose my faith in\nanesthetics. It is not reason that is taking away my faith; on the contrary,\nmy faith is based on reason. It is my imagination and emotions. The battle is\nbetween faith and reason on one side and emotion and imagination on the other\u2026\n\n>\n\n> Faith, in the sense in which I am here using the word, is the art of holding\nonto things your reason has once accepted, in spite of your changing moods.\nFor moods will change, whatever view your reason takes. I know that by\nexperience. Now that I am a Christian, I do have moods in which the whole\nthing looks very improbable; but when I was an atheist, I had moods in which\nChristianity looked terribly probable... Unless you teach your moods \"where\nthey get off\" you can never be either a sound Christian or even a sound\natheist, but just a creature dithering to and fro, with its beliefs really\ndependent on the weather and the state of its digestion. Consequently one must\ntrain the habit of faith.\n\nC. S. Lewis, _ Mere Christianity _\n\nCaveat: this is _ not at all _ how the majority of the religious people that I\nknow would use the word \"faith\". In fact, this passage turned out to be one of\nthe earliest helps in bringing me to think critically about and ultimately\ndiscard my religious worldview.\n\n",

It was a cliffhanger. He then made his salary demands.

You could feel like you're flying straight\nand level while in fact you're descending in a spiral. The solution is to\nignore what your body is telling you and listen only to your instruments.

[...] Mass movements can rise and spread without a\nbelief in God, but never without belief in a devil. Usually the strength of a\nmass movement is proportionate to the vividness and tangibility of its devil.\nWhen Hitler was asked whether he thought that the Jew must be destroyed, he\nanswered: \"No... we should then have to invent him. It is essential to have a\ntangible enemy, not merely an abstract one.\" F. A. Voigt tells of a Japanese\nmission that arrived in Berlin in 1932 to study the National Socialist\nmovement.

Watts\ndiscusses a classic paper by Lazarsfeld (1949) in which, over 60 years ago, he\nwas dealing with the common criticism that \u201csocial science doesn\u2019t tell us\nanything that we don\u2019t already know.\u201d Lazarsfeld listed a series of findings\nfrom a massive survey of 600,000 soldiers who had served during World War II;\nfor example, that men from rural backgrounds were in better spirits during\ntheir time of service than soldiers from city backgrounds. People tend to find\nall of the survey results to be pretty obvious. In this example, for instance,\npeople tend to think it obvious that rural men would have been used to harsher\nphysical conditions and thus would have adapted better to the conditions of\nmilitary life. It is likewise with all of the other findings\u2014people find them\npretty obvious. Lazarsfeld then reveals his punchline: All of the findings\nwere the opposite of what was originally stated. For example, it was _\nactually _ the case that men from city backgrounds were in better spirits\nduring their time of service than soldiers from rural backgrounds. The last\npart of the learning exercise is for people to realize how easily they would\nhave explained just the opposite finding. In the case of the actual outcome,\npeople tend to explain it (when told of it first) by saying that they expected\nit because city men are used to working in crowded conditions and under\nhierarchical authority. They never realize how easily they would have\nconcocted an explanation for exactly the opposite finding.\n\n",

For\nexample, it is not comforting to members of a graduate school admissions\ncommittee to know that only 23% of the variance in later faculty ratings of a\nstudent can be predicted by a unit weighting of the student's undergraduate\nGPA, his or her GRE score, and a measure of the student's undergraduate\ninstitution selectivity -- but that is opposed to 4% based on those committee\nmembers' global ratings of the applicant. We _ want _ to predict outcomes\nimportant to us. It is only rational to conclude that if one method (a linear\nmodel) does not predict well, something else may do better. What is not\nrational -- in fact, it's irrational -- is to conclude that this \"something\nelse\" necessarily exists and, in the absence of any positive supporting\nevidence, is intuitive global judgment.\n\nHastie &amp; Dawes, _ Rational Choice in an Uncertain World _ , pp. 67-8.\n\n",

I should address my protest especially to\nthose lovers and pursuers of Peace who, very short-sightedly, have\noccasionally adopted it. I mean the attitude which is impatient of these\npreliminary details about who did this or that, and whether it was right or\nwrong. They are satisfied with saying that an enormous calamity, called War,\nhas been begun by some or all of us; and should be ended by some or all of us.\nTo these people this preliminary chapter about the precise happenings must\nappear not only dry (and it must of necessity be the driest part of the task)\nbut essentially needless and barren. I wish to tell these people that they are\nwrong; that they are wrong upon all principles of human justice and historic\ncontinuity: but that they are specially and supremely wrong upon their own\nprinciples of arbitration and international peace.\n\n>\n\n> These sincere and high-minded peace-lovers are always telling us that\ncitizens no longer settle their quarrels by private violence; and that nations\nshould no longer settle theirs by public violence. They are always telling us\nthat we no longer fight duels; and need no longer wage wars. In short, they\nperpetually base their peace proposals on the fact that an ordinary citizen no\nlonger avenges himself with an axe. But how is he prevented from revenging\nhimself with an axe? If he hits his neighbour on the head with the kitchen\nchopper, what do we do? Do we all join hands, like children playing Mulberry\nBush, and say \"We are all responsible for this; but let us hope it will not\nspread. Let us hope for the happy day when he shall leave off chopping at the\nman's head; and when nobody shall ever chop anything for ever and ever.\" Do we\nsay \"Let byegones be byegones; why go back to all the dull details with which\nthe business began; who can tell with what sinister motives the man was\nstanding there within reach of the hatchet?\" We do not. We keep the peace in\nprivate life by asking for the facts of provocation, and the proper object of\npunishment. We do go into the dull details; we do enquire into the origins; we\ndo emphatically enquire who it was that hit first. In short we do what I have\ndone very briefly in this place.\n\n\\-- G. K.

        "markdown": "> After I spoke at the 2005 \"Mathematics and Narrative\" conference in Mykonos,\na suggestion was made that proofs by contradiction are the mathematician's\nversion of irony. I'm not sure I agree with that: when we give a proof by\ncontradiction, we make it very clear that we are discussing a counterfactual,\nso our words _ are _ intended to be taken at face value. But perhaps this is\nnot necessary. Consider the following passage.\n\n>\n\n>> There are those who would believe that every polynomial equation with\ninteger coefficients has a rational solution, a view that leads to some\nintriguing new ideas. For example, take the equation x\u00b2 - 2 = 0. Let p/q be a\nrational solution. Then (p/q)\u00b2 - 2 = 0, from which it follows that p\u00b2 = 2q\u00b2.\nThe highest power of 2 that divides p\u00b2 is obviously an even power, since if\n2^k is the highest power of 2 that divides p, then 2^2k is the highest power\nof 2 that divides p\u00b2. Similarly, the highest power of 2 that divides 2q\u00b2 is an\nodd power, since it is greater by 1 than the highest power that divides q\u00b2.\nSince p\u00b2 and 2q\u00b2 are equal, there must exist a positive integer that is both\neven and odd. Integers with this remarkable property are quite unlike the\nintegers we are familiar with: as such, they are surely worthy of further\nstudy.\n\n>\n\n> I find that it conveys the irrationality of \u221a2 rather forcefully. But could\nmathematicians afford to use this literary device? How would a reader be able\nto tell the difference in intent between what I have just written and the\nfollowing superficially similar passage?\n\n>\n\n>> There are those who would believe that every polynomial equation has a\nsolution, a view that leads to some intriguing new ideas. For example, take\nthe equation x\u00b2 + 1 = 0. Let _ i _ be a solution of this equation. Then _ i _\n\u00b2 + 1 = 0, from which it follows that _ i _ \u00b2 = -1. We know that _ i _ cannot\nbe positive, since then _ i _ \u00b2 would be positive. Similarly, _ i _ cannot be\nnegative, since _ i _ \u00b2 would again be positive (because the product of two\nnegative numbers is always positive). And _ i _ cannot be 0, since 0\u00b2 = 0. It\nfollows that we have found a number that is not positive, not negative, and\nnot zero. Numbers with this remarkable property are quite unlike the numbers\nwe are familiar with: as such, they are surely worthy of further study.\n\n  * Timothy Gowers, _ Vividness in Mathematics and Narrative _ , in _ Circles Disturbed: The Interplay of Mathematics and Narrative _\n\n",

        "markdown": "> ...a good way of thinking about minimalism [about truth] and its attractions\nis to see it as substituting the particular for the general. It mistrusts\nanything abstract or windy. Both the relativist and the absolutist are\nimpressed by Pilate's notorious question 'What is Truth?', and each tries to\nsay something useful at the same high and vertiginous level of generality. The\nminimalist can be thought of turning his back on this abstraction, and then in\nany particular case he prefaces his answer with the prior injunction: _ you\ntell me _ . This does not mean, 'You tell me what truth is.' It means, 'You\ntell me what the issue is, and I will tell you (although you will already\nknow, by then) what the truth about the issue consists in.' If the issue is\nwhether high tide is at midday, then truth consists in high tide being at\nmidday... We can tell you what truth amounts to, if you first tell us what the\nissue is.\n\n>\n\n> There is a very powerful argument for minimalism about truth, due to the\ngreat logician Gottlob Frege. First, we should notice the _ transparency _\nproperty of truth. This is the fact that it makes no difference whether you\nsay that it is raining, or it is true that it is raining, or true that it is\ntrue that it is raining, and so on forever. But if 'it is true that'\nintroduced some substantial, robust property of a judgment, how could this be\nso? Consider, for example, a pragmatism that attempts some equation between\ntruth and utility. Then next to the judgment 'it is raining' we might have 'it\nis useful to believe that it is raining.' But these are entirely different\nthings! To assess the first we direct our attention to the weather. To assess\nthe second we direct our attention to the results of believing something about\nthe weather - a very different investigation.\n\n>\n\n> Let us return to Pilate. Where does minimalism about truth leave him? It\nsuggests that when he asked this question, he was _ distracting _ himself and\nhis audience from his real job, which was to find out whether to uphold\ncertain specific historical charges against a defendant. Thus, if I am\ninnocent, and I come before a judge, I don't want airy generalities about the\nnature of truth. I want him to find that I did not steal the watch if I did\nnot steal the watch. I want him to rub his nose in the issue. I want a local\njudgment about a local or specific event, supposed to have happened in a\nparticular region of time and space.\n\n(Simon Blackburn, _ Truth _ )\n\n",

        "markdown": "> British philosophy is more detailed and piecemeal than that of the\nContinent; when it allows itself some general principle, it sets to work to\nprove it inductively by examining its various applications. Thus Hume, after\nannouncing that there is no idea without an antecedent impression, immediately\nproceeds to consider the following objection: suppose you are seeing two\nshades of colour which are similar but not identical, and suppose you have\nnever seen a shade of colour intermediate between the two, can you\nnevertheless imagine such a shade? He does not decide the question, and\nconsiders that a decision adverse to his general principle would not be fatal\nto him, because his principle is not logical but empirical. When--to take a\ncontrast--Leibniz wants to establish his monadology, he argues, roughly, as\nfollows: Whatever is complex must be composed of simple parts; what is simple\ncannot be extended; therefore everything is composed of parts having no\nextension. But what is not extended is not matter. Therefore the ultimate\nconstituents of things are not material, and, if not material, then mental.\nConsequently a table is really a colony of souls.\n\n>\n\n> The difference of method, here, may be characterized as follows: In Locke or\nHume, a comparatively modest conclusion is drawn from a broad survey of many\nfacts, whereas in Leibniz a vast edifice of deduction is pyramided upon a pin-\npoint of logical principle. In Leibniz, if the principle is completely true\nand the deductions are entirely valid, all is well; but the structure is\nunstable, and the slightest flaw anywhere brings it down in ruins. In Locke or\nHume, on the contrary, the base of the pyramid is on the solid ground of\nobserved fact, and the pyramid tapers upward, not downward; consequently the\nequilibrium is stable, and a flaw here or there can be rectified without total\ndisaster.\n\n\\--Bertrand Russell, _ A History of Western Philosophy _\n\n",

That's a theoretical optimum; any such real-world\ntransfer process, such as reading and writing an e-mail or a book, or\ntutoring, or using or influencing a market price, will pick up only a small\nfraction of even the theoretically acquirable knowledge or preferences in the\nmind(s) at the other end of said process, or if you prefer of the information\nstored by those brain(s). Of course, one can argue that some kinds of\nknowledge -- like the kinds you and I know? -- are vastly more important than\nothers, but such a claim is usually more snobbery than fact. Furthermore, a\nsociety with more such computational and mental diversity is more productive,\nbecause specialized algorithms, mental processes, and skills are generally far\nmore productive than generalized ones. As Friedrich Hayek pointed out, our\nmutual inability to understand a very high fraction of what others know has\nprofound implications for our economic and political institutions.\n\n\\-- [ Nick Szabo ](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2012/07/more-short-\ntakes.html)\n\n",

By contrast quantum thought, as I call it -- although it\nalready has a traditional name less recognizable to the modern ear, scholastic\nthought -- demands that we simultaneoulsy consider often mutually\ncontradictory possibilities. Thinking about and presenting only one side's\narguments gives one's thought and prose a false patina of consistency: a\nfallacy of thought and communications similar to false precision, but much\nmore common and imporant. Like false precision, it can be a mental mistake or\na misleading rhetorical habit. In quantum reality, by contrast, I can be both\nfor and against a proposition because I am entertaining at least two\nsignificantly possible but inconsistent hypotheses, or because I favor some\nparts of a set of ideas and not others. If you are unable or unwilling to\nthink in such a quantum or scholastic manner, it is much less likely that your\nthoughts are worthy of others' consideration.\n\n\\-- [ Nick Szabo ](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2012/07/more-short-\ntakes.html)\n\n",

When we encounter them and tell them of our science, they want to know\n_ what fatigues are _ . They have been puzzling over such questions as whether\nnumerically the same fatigue can come and go and return, whether fatigues have\na definite location in matter and space and time, whether fatigues are\nidentical with some physical states or processes or events in their bodies, or\nare made of some sort of stuff. We can see that they are off to a bad start\nwith these questions, but what should we tell them?

Look closely, asshole, it's clearly a hand.\n\n>\n\n> Look, if you really insist on doubting that here is a hand, or anything\nelse, there's nothing really I can say to convince you otherwise. What the\ntits would the world even look like if this weren't a hand? What sort of\nsystem is your doubt endorsing? After all, you can't just say \"It's not true\nthat here is a hand.\" You have to be endorsing some other picture of the\nworld. [...]\n\n>\n\n> So it turns out when I say things like \"Here is a hand\" I'm not really\nmaking a claim about the world, I'm laying down some rules for discussion. If\nyou doubt there's a hand here, then fuck you and that's all there is to it. We\ncan't really talk about anything now, because we can't even agree on something\nas simple as a goddamn hand. When we all agree here is a hand, then we can go\nabout discussing our world in meaningful ways. Skepticism just undermines a\nfoundation and replaces it with nothing; it[']s paralyzing. The grounds for\nsuch radical skepticism don't exist; it presupposes and relies on the very\ncertainty it tries to undermine.\n\n>\n\n> This is more practical than you realize. There are people who actually\nbelieve that the world is only 6,000 years old. What the fuck, right? But if\nyou've ever talked with one of them, you know that they're fucking impossible\nto have what you consider a 'reasonable' discussion with. It's not like they\ndon't have answers for everything, it[']s just that those answers don't make\nany fucking sense to you. It[']s the sort of gibberish that makes you want to\nscream. The problem is that you don't even play the game by the same goddamn\nrules. You're both certain of your positions, because those positions are\nlogically derived from the worldview each of you endorses as your starting\npoint, and you both look at each other's foundations and say, \"Seriously, what\nthe fuck are you talking about?\" You don't even know how you would go about\nconvincing them that you're right and they're wrong; you don't even agree on a\nmethod by which to do that.\n\n>\n\n> If you flew to some part of the world where they'd never heard of an\nairplane or even a bird, how the fuck could you convince them you flew? They\ndon't even know what that means. They would have all sorts of questions, and\nwould consider your answers nonsensical or magical. When a non-believer is\ntold that God exists, he reacts in the same way; also, a believer when he is\ntold there is no God.\n\n>\n\n> So everything we believe about the world is built on some sort of\nfoundation. Sure, that foundation can change, but there is always something\nthere at the base, and it is that base that enables us to talk about the\nworld. Not everyone has the same base you do, and that has to be okay. Just\nknow that some of your beliefs are just as unsupported as everyone else's.\nIt's just the way it is, bro.\n\n\u2014 [ Philosophy Bro summarizing Wittgenstein's \"On Certainty\"\n](http://www.philosophybro.com/2011/01/wittgensteins-on-certainty-\nsummary.html) .

Of these effects, the\nfirst only is immediate; it manifests itself simultaneously with its cause --\nit is seen. The others unfold in succession -- they are not seen: it is well\nfor us, if they are foreseen. Between a good and a bad economist this\nconstitutes the whole difference -- the one takes account of the visible\neffect; the other takes account both of the effects which are seen, and also\nof those which it is necessary to foresee. Now this difference is enormous,\nfor it almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is\nfavourable, the ultimate consequences are fatal, and the converse. Hence it\nfollows that the bad economist pursues a small present good, which will be\nfollowed by a great evil to come, while the true economist pursues a great\ngood to come, -- at the risk of a small present evil.\n\n>\n\n> In fact, it is the same in the science of health, arts, and in that of\nmorals. It often happens, that the sweeter the first fruit of a habit is, the\nmore bitter are the consequences. Take, for example, debauchery, idleness,\nprodigality. When, therefore, a man absorbed in the effect which is seen has\nnot yet learned to discern those which are not seen, he gives way to fatal\nhabits, not only by inclination, but by calculation.\n\n\\--From the introduction of Frederic Bastiat's [ \"That Which is Seen, and That\nWhich is Not Seen\" ](http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html) .\n\n",

Already in 1761, Leonhard Euler complained about\nisolated results which \"are not based on a systematic method\" and therefore\nwhose \"inner grounds seem to be hidden.\" Yet in the 20'th Century, writers as\ndiverse in viewpoint as Feller and de Finetti are agreed in considering\ncomputation of a result by direct application of the systematic rules of\nprobability theory as dull and unimaginative, and revel in the finding of some\nisolated clever trick by which one can see the answer to a problem without any\ncalculation.\n\n>\n\n> [...]\n\n>\n\n> Feller's perception was so keen that in virtually every problem he was able\nto see a clever trick; and then gave only the clever trick. So his readers get\nthe impression that:\n\n>\n\n>   * Probability theory has no systematic methods; it is a collection of\nisolated, unrelated clever tricks, each of which works on one problem but not\non the next one.\n\n>   * Feller was possessed of superhuman cleverness.\n\n>   * Only a person with such cleverness can hope to find new useful results\nin probability theory.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n> Indeed, clever tricks do have an aesthetic quality that we all appreciate at\nonce. But we doubt whether Feller, or anyone else, was able to see those\ntricks on first looking at the problem. We solve a problem for the first time\nby that (perhaps dull to some) direct calculation applying our systematic\nrules. After seeing the solution, we may contemplate it and see a clever trick\nthat would have led us to the answer much more quickly. Then, of course, we\nhave the opportunity for gamesmanship by showing others only the clever trick,\nscorning to mention the base means by which we first found.\n\nE. T.

The\nCatholic Church of the years during which Erasmus flourished was quite\ncorrupt. It is upon this fertile ground that the printing press added some\ncombustible fuel. But despite his influence upon them Erasmus could never be\nconvinced by the Reformers to leave the Church. Why? Erasmus was a critic of\nthe Church, but he also perceived in it a superior product to what\nProtestantism had on offer. At any given moment ** science is ** rather like\nthe Catholic Church, ** riddled with falsehood. But it is the best we have,\nand we should attempt to work within its institutional framework, rather\ntearing it apart limb from limb. ** That was Erasmus\u2019 position. He may have\nbeen a critic, but ultimately he thought the institution could be genuinely\nreformed. The struggle never ends, but we can\u2019t see any returns if we give up\nimmediately.\n\n\\--Razib Khan, [ The Erasmus Path in Science\n](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/06/the-erasmus-path-in-science/)\n\n",

The unconscious, not quite articulate, belief of most Occidentals is\nthat there is one map which adequately represents reality. By sheer good luck,\nevery Occidental thinks he or she has the map that fits. _ Guerrilla ontology\n_ , to me, involves shaking up that certainty.\n\n>\n\n> I use what in modern physics is called the \"multi-model\" approach, which is\nthe idea that there is more than one model to cover a given set of facts. As\nI've said, novel writing involves learning to think like other people. My\nnovels are written so as to force the reader to see things through different\nreality grids rather than through a single grid. It's important to abolish the\nunconscious dogmatism that makes people think their way of looking at reality\nis the only sane way of viewing the world. My goal is to try to get people\ninto a state of generalized agnosticism, not agnosticism about God alone, but\nagnosticism about everything. If one can only see things according to one's\nown belief system, one is destined to become virtually deaf, dumb, and blind.\nIt's only possible to see people when one is able to see the world as others\nsee it.\n\n>\n\n> That's what guerrilla ontology is \u2014 breaking down this one-model view and\ngiving people a multi-model perspective.\n\nRobert Anton Wilson, from [ an interview\n](http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Starship.htm)\n\n",

If a dealer is stonewalling, make it quite clear that you're willing to get what you want elsewhere.   \n* Arrive at the lowest-price dealer just before 5:00 PM to close the deal.

He told the driver to of the carriage to drive non-\nstop and the horse ran extremely fast.  \nAlong the road, there was an old man who saw them and asked, \u201cSir, you seem\nanxious, where do you need to go?\u201d  \nThe man in the carriage then replied in a loud voice, \u201cI need to go to the\nstate of Chu.\u201d The old man heard and laughing he smiled and said, \u201cYou are\ngoing the wrong way. The state of Chu is in the south, how come you are going\nto to the north?\u201d  \n\u201cThat\u2019s alright,\u201d The man in the carriage then said, \u201cCan you not see? My\nhorse runs very fast.\u201d  \n\u201cYour horse is great, but your path is incorrect.\u201d  \n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem, my carriage is new, it was made just last month.\u201d  \n\u201cYour carriage is brand new, but this is not the road one takes to get to\nChu.\u201d  \n\u201cOld Uncle, you don\u2019t know,\u201d and the man in the carriage pointed to the\nsuitcase in the back and said, \u201cIn that suitcase there\u2019s alot of money. No\nmatter how long the road is, I am not afraid.\u201d  \n\u201cYou have lots of money, but do not forget, The direction which you are going\nis wrong. I can see, you should go back the direction which you came from.\u201d  \nThe man in the carriage heard this and irritated said, \u201cI have already been\ntraveling for ten days, how can you tell me to go back from where I came?\u201d He\nthen pointed at the carriage driver and said, \u201cTake a look, he is very young,\nand he drives very well, you needn\u2019t worry. Goodbye!\u201d  \nAnd then he told the driver to drive forward, and the horse ran even faster.\n\n\\--Chinese Tale\n\n",

I believed that at the time I stood alone in hesitating to\nemploy General Gordon... With this array of opinion against me, I mistrusted\nmy own judgement. I did not yield because I hesitated to stand up against the\nstorm of public opinion. I gave a reluctant assent, in reality against my own\njudgement and inclination, because I thought that, as everybody differed from\nme, I must be wrong. I also thought I might be unconsciously prejudiced\nagainst General Gordon from the fact that his habits of thought and modes of\naction in dealing with public affairs differed widely from mine.

He paid no attention, merely went on\nwith his meal, while a tiny stream of jam trickled out of his severed\n\u0153sophagus. Only when he tried to fly away did he grasp the dreadful thing that\nhad happened to him. It is the same with modern man. The thing that has been\ncut away is his soul, and there was a period \u2014 twenty years, perhaps \u2014 during\nwhich he did not notice it.\n\n>\n\n> It was absolutely necessary that the soul should be cut away. Religious\nbelief, in the form in which we had known it, had to be abandoned. By the\nnineteenth century it was already in essence a lie, a semi-conscious device\nfor keeping the rich rich and the poor poor. The poor were to be contented\nwith their poverty, because it would all be made up to them in the world\nbeyound the grave, usually pictured as something mid-way between Kew gardens\nand a jeweller's shop. Ten thousand a year for me, two pounds a week for you,\nbut we are all the children of God. And through the whole fabric of capitalist\nsociety there ran a similar lie, which it was absolutely necessary to rip out.\n\n>\n\n> Consequently there was a long period during which nearly every thinking man\nwas in some sense a rebel, and usually a quite irresponsible rebel. Literature\nwas largely the literature of revolt or of disintegration. Gibbon, Voltaire,\nRousseau, Shelley, Byron, Dickens, Stendhal, Samuel Butler, Ibsen, Zola,\nFlaubert, Shaw, Joyce \u2014 in one way or another they are all of them destroyers,\nwreckers, saboteurs. For two hundred years we had sawed and sawed and sawed at\nthe branch we were sitting on. And in the end, much more suddenly than anyone\nhad foreseen, our efforts were rewarded, and down we came. ** But\nunfortunately there had been a little mistake. The thing at the bottom was not\na bed of roses after all, it was a cesspool full of barbed wire. **\n\n>\n\n> It is as though in the space of ten years we had slid back into the Stone\nAge. Human types supposedly extinct for centuries, the dancing dervish, the\nrobber chieftain, the Grand Inquisitor, have suddenly reappeared, not as\ninmates of lunatic asylums, but as the masters of the world. Mechanization and\na collective economy seemingly aren't enough. By themselves they lead merely\nto the nightmare we are now enduring: endless war and endless underfeeding for\nthe sake of war, slave populations toiling behind barbed wire, women dragged\nshrieking to the block, cork-lined cellars where the executioner blows your\nbrains out from behind.

The regressive prediction is reasonable, but its\naccuracy is not guaranteed. A few of the golfers who scored 66 on day 1 will\ndo even better on the second day, if their luck improves. Most will do worse,\nbecause their luck will no longer be above average.\n\n>\n\n> Now let us go against the time arrow. Arrange the players by their\nperformance on day 2 and look at their performance on day 1. You will find\nprecisely the same pattern of regression to the mean. ... The fact that you\nobserve regression when you predict an early event from a later event should\nhelp convince you that regression does not have a causal explanation.\n\n  * Daniel Kahneman, _ Thinking, Fast and Slow _\n\n",

Daily?\u201d And if daily, how many times per day?\nI dutifully wrote in, \u201cAbout 70 times per day.\u201d The next time I saw my\ninternist, she told me the insurer had recommended psychotherapy for my severe\ndepression. I explained to her why I thought about death all day\u2014merely an\noccupational hazard\u2014and she suggested getting therapy nonetheless. I thought,\nfine, it might help with the research.\n\n>\n\n> The therapist found me tragically undepressed, and I asked her if she could\nhelp me design a new life that would maximize the few years that I had left.\nAfter all, one should have a different life strategy at sixty than at twenty.\nShe asked why I thought I was going to die and why I had such a great fear of\ndeath. I said, I am going to die. It\u2019s not a fear; it\u2019s a reality. There must\nbe some behavior that could be contraindicated for a man my age but other\nnormally dangerous behavior that takes advantage of the fact that I am risking\nfewer years at sixty or sixty-five years of age than I was at twenty or\ntwenty-five (such as crimes that carry a life sentence, crushing at age twenty\nbut less so at age sixty-five). Surely psychology must have something to say\non the topic. Turns out, according to my therapist, it does not. There was\ntherapy for those with terminal illness, for the bereaved, for the about-to-\nbe-bereaved, for professionals who dealt with terminal patients, and so on,\nbut there was nothing for people who were simply aware that their life would\ncome to a natural end.

How do we get people to further question themselves when\nthey\u2019ve already become convinced that they\u2019re a rational person, a skeptic,\nand have moved on from irrationality, cognitive distortion and bias?\n\n>\n\n> Well I think what we need to do is to change the fundamental structure and\nvalues of skepticism. We need to build our community and movement around\nslightly different premises.\n\n>\n\n> As it has stood in the past, skepticism has been predicated on a belief in\nthe power of the empirical and rational. It has been based on the premise that\nthere is an empirical truth, and that it is knowable, and that certain tools\nand strategies like science and logic will allow us to reach that truth. In\nshort, the \u201cold guard\u201d skepticism was based on a veneration of the rational.\nBut the veneration of certain techniques or certain philosophies creates the\nproblematic possibility of choosing to consider certain conclusions or beliefs\nto BE empirical and rational and above criticism, particularly beliefs derived\nfrom the \u201cright\u201d tools, and even more dangerously, to consider oneself\n\u201crational\u201d.\n\n>\n\n> ...\n\n>\n\n> I believe that in order to be able to question our own beliefs as well as we\nquestion those of others, we need to restructure skepticism around awareness\nof human limitation, irrationality and flaws. Rather than venerating the\nrational, and aspiring to become some kind of superhuman fully rational vulcan\nminds, we need to instead create a more human skepticism, built around\nunderstanding how belief operates, how we draw conclusions, and how we can\ncope with the human limitations. I believe we need to remove the focus from\naspiring towards ridding ourselves of the irrational, and instead move the\nfocus towards understanding how this irrationality operates and why we believe\nall the crazy things we believe. We need to position as our primary aspiration\nnot the achievement of a perfect comprehending mind, but instead an ability to\nmaintain constant hesitation and doubt, to always always ALWAYS second-guess\nour positions and understand that they\u2019re being created through a flawed mind,\nfrom flawed perceptions.\n\n>\n\n> Science and reason are excellent tools to allow us to cope with being crazy,\nirrational human beings, but it CANNOT allow us to transcend that. The instant\nwe begin to believe that we have become A Skeptic, A Rational Person, that is\nwhen we\u2019ve fucked up, that is when we stop practicing skepticism, stop keeping\nan eye out for our mistakes, and begin to imagine our irrational perceptions\nas perfect rational conclusions. It\u2019s only by building a skepticism based on\nthe practice of doubt, rather than the state of Skeptic, that we\u2019ll truly be\nable to be move on from our assumptions.\n\n  * Natalie Reed, [ Getting Skeptics to Think Rationally About Their Skepticism ](http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/02/22/outline-getting-skeptics-to-think-skeptically-about-their-skepticism/)\n\n",

But some of the responsibility\nis on the accusers too -- if you say \"That Republican's a racist\" with the\nimplication of \"a jerk\" and then backtrack and change the meaning to\n\"vulnerable to unconscious bias\", then you're arguing in bad faith. Never mind\nthat some laws and rules which were meant to protect people from Racist3's are\nin fact deployed against Racist2's.\n\n\\- [ celandine13\n](http://theferrett.livejournal.com/1717938.html?thread=82991282#t82991282)\n\n",

One thing\nthat helps toward it is to keep a diary, or, at any rate, to keep some kind of\nrecord of one's opinions about important events. Otherwise, when some\nparticularly absurd belief is exploded by events, one may simply forget that\none ever held it. Political predictions are usually wrong. But even when one\nmakes a correct one, to discover why one was right can be very illuminating.\nIn general, one is only right when either wish or fear coincides with reality.\nIf one recognizes this, one cannot, of course, get rid of one's subjective\nfeelings, but one can to some extent insulate them from one's thinking and\nmake predictions cold-bloodedly, by the book of arithmetic. In private life\nmost people are fairly realistic. When one is making out one's weekly budget,\ntwo and two invariably make four. Politics, on the other hand, is a sort of\nsub-atomic or non-Euclidean word where it is quite easy for the part to be\ngreater than the whole or for two objects to be in the same place\nsimultaneously. Hence the contradictions and absurdities I have chronicled\nabove, all finally traceable to a secret belief that one's political opinions,\nunlike the weekly budget, will not have to be tested against solid reality.\n\n[ George Orwell ](http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/nose/english/e_nose)\n\nHe's mistaken about math and physics, possibly because he didn't expect his\nideas on the subjects to be tested against solid reality....\n\n",

One time they\nachieved it through a very holy and simple mother superior who believed that\nstudying would get me in trouble with the Inquisition and ordered me not to do\nit. I obeyed her for the three months that she was in office in as far as I\ndid not touch a book, but as far as absolutely not studying, this was not in\nmy power. [...] Even the people I spoke to, and what they said to me, gave\nrise to thousands of reflections. What was the source of all the variety of\npersonality and talent I found among them, since they were all one species?\n[...] Sometimes I would pace in front of the fireplace in one of our large\ndormitories and notice that, though the lines of two sides were parallel and\nits ceiling level, to our vision it appears as though the lines are inclined\ntoward each other and the ceiling is lower in the distance than it is nearby.\nFrom this it can be inferred that the lines of our vision run straight, but\nnot parallel, to form the figure of a pyramid. And I wondered if that was the\nreason that the ancients questioned whether the earth was a sphere or not.\nBecause although it seemed so, their vision might have deceived them, showing\nconcave shapes where there were none. [...] Once I saw two girls playing with\na top, and hardly had I seen the movement and the shape when I began, in my\ninsane way, to consider the easy movement of the spherical shape and how long\nthe momentum, once established, remained independent of its original cause,\nthe distant hand of the girl. Not content with this I had flour brought and\nsprinkled on the floor in order to discover whether the spinning top would\ndescribe perfect circles or not. It turned out that they were not perfect\ncircles but spirals that lost their circular shape to the degree that the top\nlost momentum.\n\nSister Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, 1691 (tr.

Are the scientists\njust being philistines, betraying their tin ears for the subtleties of\nphilosophical investigation, or have the philosophers who indulge in these\nexercises lost their grip on reality?\n\n>\n\n> These bizarre examples all attempt to prove one \"conceptual\" point or\nanother by deliberately reducing something underappreciated to zero, so that\nWhat Really Counts can shine through. Blockheads hold peripheral behavior\nconstant and reduce internal structural details (and--what comes to the same\nthing--intervening internal processes) close to zero, and provoke the\nintuition that then there would be no mind there; internal structure Really\nCounts. Manthra is more or less the mirror-image; it keeps internal processes\nconstant and reduces control of peripheral behavior to zero, showing,\npresumably, that external behavior Really Doesn't Count. Swampman keeps both\nfuture peripheral dispositions and internal states constant and reduces\n\"history\" to zero. Twin Earth sets internal similarity to maximum, so that\nexternal context can be demonstrated to be responsible for whatever our\nintuitions tell us. Thus these thought experiments mimic empirical experiments\nin their design, attempting to isolate a crucial interaction between variables\nby holding other variables constant. In the past I have often noted that a\nproblem with such experiments is that the dependent variable is \"intuition\"--\nthey are intuition pumps--and the contribution of imagination in the\ngeneration of intuitions is harder to control than philosophers have usually\nacknowledged.\n\n>\n\n> But there is also a deeper problem with them. It is child's play to dream up\nfurther such examples to \"prove\" further conceptual points. ** Suppose a cow\ngave birth to something that was atom-for-atom indiscernible from a shark.\nWould it be a shark? What is the truth-maker for sharkhood? If you posed that\nquestion to a biologist, the charitable reaction would be that you were making\na labored attempt at a joke. Suppose an evil demon could make water turn solid\nat room temperature by smiling at it; would demon-water be ice? Too silly a\nhypothesis to deserve a response. ** All such intuition pumps depend on the\ndistinction spelled out by McLaughlin and O'Leary-Hawthorne between\n\"conceptual\" and \"reductive\" answers to the big questions. What I hadn't\nsufficiently appreciated in my earlier forthright response to Jackson is that\nwhen one says that the truth-maker question requires a conceptual answer, one\nmeans an answer that holds not just in our world, or all nomologically\npossible worlds, but in all logically possible worlds. ** Smiling demons, cow-\nsharks, Blockheads, and Swampmen are all, some philosophers think, logically\npossible, even if they are not nomologically possible, and these philosophers\nthink this is important. I do not. Why should the truth-maker question cast\nits net this wide? Because, I gather, otherwise its answer doesn't tell us\nabout the essence of the topic in question. But who believes in real essences\nof this sort nowadays? Not I. **\n\nDaniel Dennett, [ \"Get Real\"\n](http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/getreal.htm) (emphasis added).\n\n",

There is at least some risk that the god will lose this battle, and so\nthe Sun may not rise tomorrow\u2019.

You can easily train your brain to overcome this but it does take\nsome work on your part. So it probably isn\u2019t going to happen. But I\u2019ll do my\npart trying to point out your many and varied shortcomings and you can go\nalong, nodding wisely and congratulating me on my benevolent teachings while\nall the while planning to ignore me and do things the same way as before.\n[...]\n\nThe family house you grow up in is what you see as normal. That is the\ndefinition of shelter in your life. If you encounter a new product, that first\nprice is what you use as a \u201cnormal\u201d one. So everything can suffer from your\nfirst encounters ( or look better in comparison ). This is why most people\nwon\u2019t look for shelter. They look for a house. Or an apartment. Whatever they\nare used to. They are not used to finding a way to keep the elements out, they\nare used to finding a house or apartment. This is the way it is done and any\nsuggestion otherwise is ignored. They might pretend to be open to new ideas\nbut once they find fault with any way other than their own they can claim to\nbe objective while remaining safely cocooned in their normal world.\n\nPeople don\u2019t look at how to get from one point to another. They don\u2019t look at\nthe need for transportation, they look at the need for a car. So by comparison\nshopping for cars they ignore scooters or bicycles or public transport or even\ncarpooling. They are used to having a car and that is the only way to do it.\nPeople don\u2019t look at how to become secure, they look at how to make money. To\nthem money equals security and there is no other way. They ignore being out of\ndebt, they ignore decreasing dependence on a paycheck ( note I said decrease,\nnot eliminate ). They ignore all but getting money. This is how it was done\nbefore and it is how they are going to continue to do it.\n\n~James Dakin, [ throwing the anchor overboard\n](http://bisonsurvivalblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/throwing-anchor-\noverboard.html)\n\n",

With a few exceptions we can\ndiscuss, I think the future is inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We are\nway better off if we accept the enormous uncertainty that pervades the world\nand approach it with a sense of adventure and mystery... There are a couple of\nsmall but important exceptions to the unpredictability of the unfolding. We\ncan notice a current reality that is hidden or nonobvious. We might notice the\nreality by looking at data, watching conversations, or observing practices. We\nthen discuss the reality and its consequences in the near term -- a year or\ntwo is easiest, but sometimes we can go up to five years. Management guru\nPeter Drucker was a master at this; he said that others who rated him as a\ngood prognosticator were wrong because all he was doing was revealing current\ntruths that most of them had missed.\n\n\\- [ Peter Denning ](http://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=1979464)\n\n",

We\nattack his positions and we defend our own. We gain and lose ground. We plan\nand use strategies. If we find a position indefensible, we can abandon it and\ntake a new line of attack. Many of the things we do in arguing are partially\nstructured by the concept of war. Though there is no physical battle, there is\na verbal battle, and the structure of an argument--attack, defense, counter-\nattack, etc.---reflects this. It is in this sense that the ARGUMENT IS WAR\nmetaphor is one that we live by in this culture; its structures the actions we\nperform in arguing. Try to imagine a culture where arguments are not viewed in\nterms of war, where no one wins or loses, where there is no sense of attacking\nor defending, gaining or losing ground. Imagine a culture where an argument is\nviewed as a dance, the participants are seen as performers, and the goal is to\nperform in a balanced and aesthetically pleasing way. In such a culture,\npeople would view arguments differently, experience them differently, carry\nthem out differently, and talk about them differently.\n\n-George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, _ Metaphors We Live By _ . \n\n",

The seer pointed to a certain bird he was\nobserving, and told him that if it stayed in that spot, they would do well to\nwait around for a while. If it got up and flew forward, then they would be\nfree to proceed; if, however, it flew backward, they were to turn back.\n\n>>\n\n>> The Jew, without saying a word, drew his bow and shot, hitting the bird and\nkilling it. The seer and some of the others became indignant and began heaping\ncurses on him. \"What you poor people getting so upset about?\" he asked. Then,\npicking up the bird in his hand, he said: \"How could any sound information\nabout our journey have been provided by this poor creature, who was unable to\nmake provision for his own safety?

The whole thrust of professional\nphilosophy is toward inventing ways to regard opposing arguments as failure,\nas long as those ways don't exhibit any obvious flaws. However much\nphilosophers are interested in the truth, philosophy as a profession is not\nstructured so as to converge on it; it is structured so as to have the maximal\npossible divergence that can be sustained given common conventions.

He and the pilot have just caught sight of her in\nthe sea below. Night is approaching.\n\nMarshall: Where do you reckon they're making for?  \nPilot: It looks like they're putting into Inverkerran for the night.  \nMarshall: Tell me, if _ they _ thought I thought they were going to\nInverkerran, where do you reckon they would make for _ then _ ?  \nPilot: Strathcathaig, maybe.  \nMarshall: This sounds silly, but if they thought I'd think they were going to\nStrathcathaig because it looked as if they were going to Inverkerran -- where\nwould they go then?  \nPilot: My guess would be Pennymaddy.  \nMarshall: If there's such a thing as a triple bluff, I bet Mactaggart invented\nit. Okay, Pennymaddy.\n\n\\--Cut to aboard the puffer--\n\nMactaggart: Aye, he'll have guessed we're making for Inverkerran.  \nHamish: Will he not go there himself, then?  \nMactaggart: Oh, no. He'll know we know he's seen us, so he'll be expecting us\nto head for Strathcathaig instead.  \nHamish: Will I set her for Pennymaddy, then?  \nMactaggart: No, If it should occur to him that it's occurred to us that he's\nexpecting us to go to Strathcathaig, he would think we'll be making for\nPennymaddy.  \nHamish: Well, then, shall I set her for Penwhannoy?  \nMactaggart: No. We'll make for Inverkerran just as we planned.

Since there is generally only one right way of doing things (or\nperhaps a few) but very many wrong ways, the \"rational\" behavior can be\npredicted but the \"irrational\" behavior cannot. If we predict the person's\nbehavior on the assumption that he is rational, we will be right half the\ntime. If we assume he is irrational, we will almost never be right, since we\nstill have to guess _ which _ irrational thing he will do. We are better off\nassuming he is rational and recognizing that we will sometimes be wrong. To\nput the argument more generally, the tendency to be rational is the consistent\n(and hence predictable) element in human behavior. The only alternative to\nassuming rationality (other than giving up and assuming that human behavior\ncannot be understood and predicted) would be a _ theory _ of irrational\nbehavior - a theory that told us not only that someone would not always do the\nrational thing but also _ which particular irrational thing _ he would do.

Their aim is to make the unintelligible\nsimple, and even obvious. So on what seem to be higher levels. No man who has\nnot had a long and arduous education can understand even the most elementary\nconcepts of modern pathology. But even a hind at the plough can grasp the\ntheory of chiropractic in two lessons. Hence the vast popularity of\nchiropractic among the submerged - and of osteopathy, Christian Science and\nother such quackeries with it. They are idiotic, but they are simple - and\nevery man prefers what he can understand to what puzzles and dismays him. The\npopularity of fundamentalism among the inferior orders of men is explicable in\nexactly the same way. The cosmogenies that educated men toy with are all\ninordinately complex. To comprehend their veriest outlines requires an immense\nstock of knowledge, and a habit of thought. It would be be as vain to try to\nteach the peasants or to the city proletariat as it would be to try to teach\nthem to streptococci. But the cosmogeny of Genesis is so simple that even a\nyokel can grasp it. It is set forth in a few phrases. It offers, to an\nignorant man, the irresistible reasonableness of the nonsensical. So he\naccepts it with loud hosannas, and has one more excuse for hating his betters.\n\nH. L. Mencken, _ Homo Neanderthalensis _\n\n",

Let us engage in a mental experiment by way of\ntrying to construct proverbial wisdom out of the relationship between\nterrestrial life, its pleasures, and its Beyond. If ones says, \"Forget about\nthe afterlife, about the Elsewhere, seize the day, enjoy life fully here and\nnow, it's the only life you've got!\" it sounds deep. If one says exactly the\nopposite (\"Do not get trapped in the illusory and vain pleasures of earthly\nlife; money, power, and passions are all destined to vanish into thin air -\nthink about eternity!\"), it also sounds deep. If one combines the two sides\n(\"Bring Eternity into your everyday life, live your life on this earth as if\nit is already permeated by Eternity!\"), we get another profound thought.\nNeedless to add, the same goes for it's inversion: \"Do not try in vain to\nbring together Eternity and your terrestrial life, accept humbly that you are\nforever split between Heaven and Earth!\" If, finally, one simply gets\nperplexed by all these reversals and claims: \"Life is an enigma, do not try to\npenetrate its secrets, accept the beauty of its unfathomable mystery!\" the\nresult is, again, no less profound than its reversal: \"Do not allow yourself\nto be distracted by false mysteries that just dissimulate the fact that,\nultimately, life is very simple - it is what it is, it is simply here without\nreason and rhyme!\" Needless to add that, by uniting mystery and simplicity,\none again obtains a wisdom: \"The ultimate, unfathomable mystery of life\nresides in its very simplicity, in the simple fact that there is life.\"\n\n  * Slavoj Zizek \n\n",

One person recently, goaded\ninto desperation by the litany of unrelieved negation, burst out \"Don't you\nbelieve in anything?\" \"Yes\", I said. \"I believe in evidence. I believe in\nobservation, measurement, and reasoning, confirmed by independent observers.\nI'll believe anything, no matter how wild and ridiculous, if there is evidence\nfor it. The wilder and more ridiculous something is, however, the firmer and\nmore solid the evidence will have to be.\"\n\nIsaac Asimov\n\n",

        "markdown": "> One of the most serious problems with modern \"management\" is that the\nincentives are all wrong. Imagine that I hire a programmer and pay him by the\nline of code. This idea has been so thoroughly debunked that it is nearly\nimpossible to write out the consequences without sounding clich\u00e9. Yet it\nhappens all the time: Companies promote \"Architects\" who are evaluated by the\nweight of their \"architecture.\" The result is stultifying and demoralizing.\nThe architect does not work to facilitate the programmer's work, he works to\nproduce evidence of his contribution in the form of frameworks, standards, and\nsoftware process.\n\n>\n\n> So, how are most managers evaluated? By the amount of \"managing\" they do, as\nmeasured by the amount of process they impose on their team. Evaluating a\nmanager by the amount of managing they _ do _ is exactly the same thing as\nevaluating a programmer by the amount of code they write. And it produces\nresults like you describe, where the manager works to produce evidence of\ntheir management in the form of processes and decisions from the top down,\nrather than facilitating the work actually being done.\n\n-raganwald, HN, [ http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2423236 ](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2423236)\n\n",

By\nthis, I mean that there are many individuals who wish to make inferences about\nthe world based on data which they observe, or offer up general typologies to\nframe a subsequent analysis. These individuals tend to be intelligent and have\ncollege degrees. Their discussion ranges over topics such as politics, culture\nand philosophy. But, introduction of questions about the moments about the\ndistribution, or skepticism as to the representativeness of their sample, and\nso on, tends to have a chilling affect on the regular flow of discussion.\nWhile the average human being engages mostly in gossip and interpersonal\nconversation of some sort, the self-consciously intellectual interject a bit\nof data and abstraction (usually in the form of jargon or pithy quotations)\ninto the mix. But the raison d'etre of the intellectual discussion is\nbasically signaling and cuing; in other words, social display. No one really\ncares about the details and attempting to generate a rigorous model is really\nbeside the point. Trying to push the N much beyond 2 or 3 (what you would see\nin a college essay format) will only elicit eye-rolling and irritation.\n\n\\-- [ Razib Khan ](http://www.gnxp.com/blog/2007/10/why-people-dont-care-\nabout-statistics.php)\n\n",

Dragged by palace guards\nto the Shah's throne room, he was sentenced immediately to death.\n\n>\n\n> As he was being taken away, however, Nasruddin cried out to the Shah: \"O\ngreat Shah, if you spare me, I promise that within a year I will teach your\nfavourite horse to sing!\"\n\n>\n\n> The Shah knew that Sufis often told the most outrageous fables, which\nsounded blasphemous to many Muslims but which were nevertheless intended as\nlessons to those who would learn. Thus he had been tempted to be merciful,\nanyway, despite the demands of his own religious advisors. Now, admiring the\naudacity of the old man, and being a gambler at heart, he accepted his\nproposal.\n\n>\n\n> The next morning, Nasruddin was in the royal stable, singing hymns to the\nShah's horse, a magnificent white stallion. The animal, however, was more\ninterested in his oats and hay, and ignored him. The grooms and stablehands\nall shook their heads and laughed at him. \"You old fool\", said one. \"What have\nyou accomplished by promising to teach the Shah's horse to sing? You are bound\nto fail, and when you do, the Shah will not only have you killed - you'll be\ntortured as well, for mocking him!\"\n\n>\n\n> Nasruddin turned to the groom and replied: \"On the contrary, I have indeed\naccomplished much. Remember, I have been granted another year of life, which\nis precious in itself. Furthermore, in that time, many things can happen. I\nmight escape. Or I might die anyway. Or the Shah might die, and his successor\nwill likely release all prisoners to celebrate his accession to the throne\".\n\n>\n\n> \"Or...\". Suddenly, Nasruddin smiled. \"Or, perhaps, the horse will learn to\nsing\".\n\nThe original source of this fable seems to be lost to time.

And the giants would also carry them\nwherever they wanted to go, provided they asked in the proper way. So it came\nabout that men never thought of working, nor of walking, nor of building\nwagons or ships; instead they became natural orators, and spent all of their\ntime watching the giants, figuring out what would please or displease them,\nsmiling at them or imploring them with tears in their eyes; or else simply\npronouncing the necessary words, which had to be memorized exactly, though\nthey had no understanding of the changes of humor that would come over the\ngiants, their brusque refusals, or their sudden willingness. Now, if some man,\nin those days, had tried to get something for himself by his own industry,\nthey would have laughed him to scorn; for the results of his labor would have\nbeen puny beside the immense provisions the giants had amassed; and besides\nwith one false step the giants could easily have crushed those little\nbeginnings of labor out of existence. That is why all human wisdom came down\nto knowing how to speak and how to persuade; and, rather than move things\nabout with great effort, men chose to learn what words it would take to get\none of the giants to do their moving. In short, their main business, or rather\ntheir only business, was to please, and above all not to displease, their\nincomprehensible masters, who seemed nevertheless to be charged with\nnourishing them and housing them and transporting them, and who eventually\ncarried out their duties, provided they were prayed to. This kind of\nexistence, in which men never knew whether they were the masters or the\nslaves, lasted for a long time, so that the habit of asking, of hoping, of\ncounting on those stronger than themselves left indelible traces in human\nnature. . . . That is why, as if they were still waiting for the return of the\ngiants, men do not forget to pray and make offerings, though no giant has ever\nshown himself . . .\n\n\\-- \" [ Alain ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Chartier) \" (\u00c9mile\nChartier) _ The Gods. _ A meditation on childhood.\n\n",

Mara was about Dann\u2019s age when she was first\ncalled into her father\u2019s room one evening, where he sat in his big carved and\ncoloured chair. He said to her, \u2018And now we are going to play a game. What was\nthe thing you liked best today?\u2019\n\n>\n\n> At first she chattered: \u2018I played with my cousin . . . I was out with Shera\nin the garden . . . I made a stone house.\u2019 And then he had said, \u2018Tell me\nabout the house.\u2019 And she said, \u2018I made a house of the stones that come from\nthe river bed.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Now tell me about the stones.\u2019 And she said,\n\u2018They were mostly smooth stones, but some were sharp and had different\nshapes.\u2019 \u2018Tell me what the stones looked like, what colour they were, what did\nthey feel like.\u2019\n\n>\n\n> And by the time the game ended she knew why some stones were smooth and some\nsharp and why they were different colours, some cracked, some so small they\nwere almost sand. She knew how rivers rolled stones along and how some of them\ncame from far away. She knew that the river had once been twice as wide as it\nwas now. There seemed no end to what she knew, and yet her father had not told\nher much, but kept asking questions so she found the answers in herself. Like,\n\u2018Why do you think some stones are smooth and round and some still sharp?\u2019 And\nshe thought and replied, \u2018Some have been in the water a long time, rubbing\nagainst other stones, and some have only just been broken off bigger stones.\u2019\nEvery evening, either her father or her mother called her in for What Did You\nSee? She loved it. During the day, playing outside or with her toys, alone or\nwith other children, she found herself thinking, Now notice what you are\ndoing, so you can tell them tonight what you saw.\n\n>\n\n> She had thought that the game did not change; but then one evening she was\nthere when her little brother was first asked, What Did You See? and she knew\njust how much the game had changed for her. Because now it was not just What\nDid You See? but: What were you thinking? What made you think that? Are you\nsure that thought is true?\n\n>\n\n> When she became seven, not long ago, and it was time for school, she was in\na room with about twenty children \u2013 all from her family or from the Big Family\n\u2013 and the teacher, her mother\u2019s sister, said, \u2018And now the game: What Did You\nSee?\u2019\n\n>\n\n> Most of the children had played the game since they were tiny; but some had\nnot, and they were pitied by the ones that had, for they did not notice much\nand were often silent when the others said, \u2018I saw . . .\u2019, whatever it was.\nMara was at first upset that this game played with so many at once was\nsimpler, more babyish, than when she was with her parents. It was like going\nright back to the earliest stages of the game: \u2018What did you see?\u2019 \u2018I saw a\nbird.\u2019 \u2018What kind of a bird?\u2019 \u2018It was black and white and had a yellow beak.\u2019\n\u2018What shape of beak? Why do you think the beak is shaped like that?\u2019\n\n>\n\n> Then she saw what she was supposed to be understanding: Why did one child\nsee this and the other that? Why did it sometimes need several children to see\neverything about a stone or a bird or a person?\n\nDoris Lessing, \"Mara and Dann\"\n\n",

Our\nanalysis will instead show that self-improvement acts to create predictable\nregularities. It builds on the intellectual foundations of microeconomics, the\nscience of preference and choice in the face of uncertainty. The basic theory\nwas created by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in 1944 for situations\nwith objective uncertainty and was later extended by Savage and Anscombe and\nAumann to situations with subjective uncertainty. Our analysis shows that\nwhile the preferences of self-improving systems will depend on their origins,\nthey will act on those preferences in predictable ways. Repeated self-\nimprovement brings intelligent agents closer to an ideal that economists\nsometimes call \u201cHomo Economicus\u201d. Ironically, human behavior is not well\ndescribed by this ideal and the field of \u201cbehavioral economics\u201d has emerged in\nrecent years to study how humans actually behave. The classical economic\ntheory is much more applicable to self-improving systems because they will\ndiscover and eliminate their own irrationalities in ways that humans cannot.\n\nSteve Omohundro, \" [ The Nature of Self-Improving Artificial Intelligence\n](http://selfawaresystems.com/2007/10/05/paper-on-the-nature-of-self-\nimproving-artificial-intelligence/) \" 2007\n\n",

The voice at the back of\nthe room very hesitantly replied, \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I had in mind.\u201d Then the\nvisitor\u2019s fist really came down as he thundered, \u201cOf course not.

        "markdown": "Witching was turning out to be mostly hard work and really short on magic of\nthe zap!-glingle-glingle-glingle variety. There was no school and nothing that\nwas exactly like a lesson. But it wasn\u2019t wise to try to learn witching all by\nyourself, especially if you had a natural talent. If you got it wrong, you\ncould go from ignorant to cackling in a week ...\n\nWhen you got right down to it, it was all about cackling. No one ever talked\nabout this, though. Witches said things like \u201cYou can never be too old, too\nskinny, or too warty,\u201d but they never mentioned the cackling. Not properly.\nThey watched out for it, though, all the time.\n\nIt was all too easy to become a cackler. Most witches lived by themselves (cat\noptional) and might go for weeks without ever seeing another witch. In those\ntimes when people hated witches, they were often accused of talking to their\ncats. Of course they talked to their cats. After three weeks without an\nintelligent conversation that wasn\u2019t about cows, you\u2019d talk to the wall. And\nthat was an early sign of cackling.\n\n\u201cCackling,\u201d to a witch, didn\u2019t just mean nasty laughter. It meant your mind\ndrifting away from its anchor. It meant you losing your grip. It meant\nloneliness and hard work and responsibility and other people\u2019s problems\ndriving you crazy a little bit at a time, each bit so small that you\u2019d hardly\nnotice it, until you thought that it was normal to stop washing and wear a\nkettle on your head. It meant you thinking that the fact you knew more than\nanyone else in your village made you better than them. It meant thinking that\nright and wrong were negotiable. And, in the end, it meant you \u201cgoing to the\ndark,\u201d as the witches said. That was a bad road. At the end of that road were\npoisoned spinning wheels and gingerbread cottages.\n\nWhat stopped this was the habit of visiting. Witches visited other witches all\nthe time, sometimes traveling quite a long way for a cup of tea and a bun.\nPartly this was for gossip, of course, because witches love gossip, especially\nif it\u2019s more exciting than truthful. But mostly it was to keep an eye on one\nanother.\n\nToday Tiffany was visiting Granny Weatherwax, who was in the opinion of most\nwitches (including Granny herself) the most powerful witch in the mountains.\nIt was all very polite. No one said, \u201cNot gone bats, then?\u201d or \u201cCertainly not!\nI\u2019m as sharp as a spoon!\u201d They didn\u2019t need to. They understood what it was all\nabout, so they talked of other things. But when she was in a mood, Granny\nWeatherwax could be hard work.\n\n  * Pratchett, \"Wintersmith\" \n\n",

Materialists simply explain the facts, without making use of such\nphrases, they do this first when importunate pious believers try to force God\nupon them, and then they answer curtly, either like Laplace: Sire, je n\u2019avais\npas, etc., or more rudely in the manner of the Dutch merchants who, when\nGerman commercial travellers press their shoddy goods on them, are accustomed\nto turn them away with the words: Ik kan die zaken niet gebruiken [I have no\nuse for the things] and that is the end of the matter: But what God has had to\nsuffer at the hands of his defenders!

One division of the army\nafter another lays down its arms, one fortress after another capitulates\nbefore the march of science, until at last the whole infinite realm of nature\nis conquered by science, and there is no place left in it for the Creator.\nNewton still allowed Him the \u201cfirst impulse\u201d but forbade Him any further\ninterference \u2018in his solar system. Father Secchi bows Him out of the solar\nsystem altogether, with all canonical honours it is true, but none the less\ncategorically for all that, and he only allows Him a creative act as regards\nthe primordial nebula. And so in all spheres. In biology, his last great Don\nQuixote, Agassiz, even ascribes positive nonsense to Him; He is supposed to\nhave created not only the actual animals but also abstract animals, the fish\nas such! And finally Tyndall totally forbids Him any entry into nature and\nrelegates Him to the world of emotional processes, only admitting Him because,\nafter all, there must be somebody who knows more about all these things\n(nature) than John Tyndall!

I do\nnot mean by this that people who cannot write well have no character or that\nwriting is the only way in which people can show their character. I mean,\nsimply, that you cannot write well if you do not make this connection, because\nnot to make it is to fail, as a writer, in holding yourself accountable for\nthe quality of your own thinking. Or, to put it another way, it is to fail to\ntake your own intellect seriously. As a teacher, primarily of writing but also\nof literature, I measure my success not in how many A\u2019s or B\u2019s I give\nout\u2014since grades reflect the surface of learning, not necessarily its\nquality\u2014but in whether my students have begun to take on the responsibility\nnot simply of having ideas, but of having the audacity, because we lie to our\nstudents if we do not acknowledge that it takes courage, to attempt to\ncommunicate those ideas in words compelling enough to command a reader\u2019s\nattention above and beyond the fact that they were written in response to a\nclassroom assignment\u2026.

I\ncare not (in this place) what your principles are. Your principles may induce\nyou to believe in the righteousness of burglary. I don't mind. All I urge is\nthat a life in which conduct does not fairly well accord with principles is a\nsilly life; and that conduct can only be made to accord with principles by\nmeans of daily examination, reflection, and resolution. What leads to the\npermanent sorrowfulness of burglars is that their principles are contrary to\nburglary. If they genuinely believed in the moral excellence of burglary,\npenal servitude would simply mean so many happy years for them; all martyrs\nare happy, because their conduct and their principles agree.\n\nAs for reason (which makes conduct, and is not unconnected with the making of\nprinciples), it plays a far smaller part in our lives than we fancy. We are\nsupposed to be reasonable but we are much more instinctive than reasonable.\nAnd the less we reflect, the less reasonable we shall be. The next time you\nget cross with the waiter because your steak is over-cooked, ask reason to\nstep into the cabinet-room of your mind, and consult her. She will probably\ntell you that the waiter did not cook the steak, and had no control over the\ncooking of the steak; and that even if he alone was to blame, you accomplished\nnothing good by getting cross; you merely lost your dignity, looked a fool in\nthe eyes of sensible men, and soured the waiter, while producing no effect\nwhatever on the steak. \" - Arnold Bennett, How to Live on 24 hours per day.\n\n",

Now, I won't just assert that, I'll\nprove it to you: I will prove that although you might work till you drop, you\ncan't predict whether a program will stop.\n\n>\n\n> Imagine we have a procedure called P that will snoop in the source code of\nprograms to see there aren't infinite loops that round and around; and P\nprints the word \"Fine!\" if no looping is found.\n\n>\n\n> You feed in your code, and the input it needs, and then P takes them both\nand it studies and reads and computes whether things will all end as they\nshould (as opposed to going loopy the way that they could).\n\n>\n\n> Well, the truth is that P cannot possibly be, because if you wrote it and\ngave it to me, I could use it to set up a logical bind that would shatter your\nreason and scramble your mind.\n\n>\n\n> Here's the trick I would use\u2014and it's simple to do. I'd define a\nprocedure\u2014we'll name the thing Q\u2014 that would take any program and call P (of\ncourse!) to tell if it looped, by reading the source;\n\n>\n\n> And if so, Q would simply print \"Loop!\" and then stop; but if no, Q would go\nright back up to the top, and start off again, looping endlessly back, till\nthe universe dies and is frozen and black.\n\n>\n\n> And this program called Q wouldn't stay on the shelf; I would run it, and\n(fiendishly) feed it itself. What behavior results when I do this with Q? When\nit reads its own source code, just what will it do?\n\n>\n\n> If P warns of loops, Q will print \"Loop!\" and quit; yet P is supposed to\nspeak truly of it. So if Q's going to quit, then P should say, \"Fine!\"\u2014 which\nwill make Q go back to its very first line!\n\n>\n\n> No matter what P would have done, Q will scoop it: Q uses P's output to make\nP look stupid.

I don't have to tell you; I'm sure\nyou can guess. By reductio, there cannot possibly be a procedure that acts\nlike the mythical P.\n\n>\n\n> You can never discover mechanical means for predicting the acts of computing\nmachines.

Different groups of people play different games (different rules =\ndifferent game), so if you want to play in different groups, you have to learn\nthe games they play.

They want to believe that\nthe rules they know are the ones that everyone ought to play by; they even set\nup systems of punishment and reward to make sure that nobody tries to play a\ndifferent game. They turn the game into something that is deadly serious, and\nso my idea simply seems frivolous instead of liberating.\n\nWilliam T. Powers\n\n",

It is unrealistic, for it\ntakes too simple a view of the talents of man and of the circumstances which\nencourage, or cause, their development. And it is pernicious, for the attempt\nto enforce the rules is bound to increase our professional qualifications at\nthe expense of our humanity. In addition, the idea is detrimental to science,\nfor it neglects the complex physical and historical conditions which influence\nscientific change. It makes our science less adaptable and more dogmatic:\nevery methodological rule is associated with cosmological assumptions, so that\nusing the rule we take it for granted that the assumptions are correct. Naive\nfalsificationism takes it for granted that the laws of nature are manifest and\nnot hidden beneath disturbances of considerable magnitude. Empiricism takes it\nfor granted that sense experience is a better mirror of the world than pure\nthought. Praise of argument takes it for granted that the artifices of Reason\ngive better results than the unchecked play of our emotions. Such assumptions\nmay be perfectly plausible and even true. Still, one should occasionally put\nthem to a test. Putting them to a test means that we stop using the\nmethodology associated with them, start doing science in a different way and\nsee what happens. Case studies such as those reported in the preceding\nchapters show that such tests occur all the time, and that they speak against\nthe universal validity of any rule.

But general improvement is so little to be anticipated, that\nalmost any attempt which may be made by an individual in his zeal to do good,\nseems to be lost labour. Those whose character has attained to the greatest\nperfectness, are at all times the persons most willing and anxious to avail\nthemselves of any hint or suggestion which might tend to improve them in\nvirtue and knowledge, so that what is intended for universal benefit serves\nbut to instruct a very few, and those few the individuals who require it\nleast. Serious works, meant to reform the careless, are read only by those who\nalready are serious, and disposed to assent to what such works set forth. In\nthat case their object, humanly speaking, is in a great measure defeated. It\nseems hopeless to attempt to infuse a taste for serious reading into the minds\nof the thoughtless multitude. Write down to the capacity of the weak and\nslenderly informed, or write up to the taste of the intellectual portion of\nthem; give it cheap, or give it for nothing, it is all the same--a man will\nnot thus be forced or induced to read what you put in print for his especial\nbenefit.\n\n>\n\n> The most powerful means, therefore, of promoting what is good, is by\nexample, and this means is what is in every individual's power. One man only\nin a thousand, perhaps, can write a book to instruct his neighbours, and his\nneighbours in their perversity will not read it to be instructed. But every\nman may be a pattern of living excellence to those around him, and it is\nimpossible but that, in his peculiar sphere, it will have its own weight and\nefficacy; for no man is insignificant who tries to do his duty--and he that\nsuccessfully performs his duty, holds, by that very circumstance, a station,\nand possesses an influence in society, superior to that which can be acquired\nby any other distinction whatever. But it is only those who propose to\nthemselves the very highest standard, that attain to this distinction. There\nare many different estimates of what a _ rationalist _ 's duty is, and society\nis so constituted, that very false notions are formed of that in which true\nexcellence and greatness consists; besides, many men who are theoretically\nright are practically wrong--all which detracts from the weight of _ rational\n_ influence upon human society. But however much human opinion may vary, and\nhowever inconsistent human practice may be, there is but one right rule; and\nit is only he who has this rule well defined in his own mind, who can exhibit\nthat preeminence in the _ rational _ life which is the noblest distinction to\nwhich man can attain. It is deeply to be regretted that they who seek for this\npreeminence are a very small number compared with the mass of the professedly\n_ rational _ world. But small though the number be, the good which might be\neffected through their means is incalculable, if they were bound as in solemn\ncompact to discountenance all those vices and habits which the usages of\nsociety have established into reputable virtues--thus becoming as it were a\nband of conspirators against the [ _ formless lord _\n](http://lesswrong.com/lw/kr/an_alien_god/) of this world and his kingdom--\ntransfusing and extending their principles and influence, till they draw men\noff from their allegiance to that old tyrant by whom they have been so long\nwillingly enslaved.\n\nThe italicised words are where I made some systematic substitutions from the\noriginal text, and of course the hyperlink is not in the original.

In the meantime it will have become very hard\nfor you to learn from anybody who doesn't have these clearances. Because\nyou'll be thinking as you listen to them: 'What would this man be telling me\nif he knew what I know? Would he be giving me the same advice, or would it\ntotally change his predictions and recommendations?' And that mental exercise\nis so torturous that after a while you give it up and just stop listening.\n\n[...]\n\nYou will deal with a person who doesn't have those clearances only from the\npoint of view of what you want him to believe and what impression you want him\nto go away with, since you'll have to lie carefully to him about what you\nknow. In effect, you will have to manipulate him. You'll give up trying to\nassess what he has to say. The danger is, you'll become something like a\nmoron.

What\u2019s wrong with economists acting in\nthis sort of way? I\u2019ll tell you a tale about an English economist, Ely Devons.\nI was at a conference and he said, \u201cLet\u2019s consider what an economist would do\nif he wanted to study horses.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat would he do? He\u2019d go to his\nstudy and think, \u2018What would I do if I were a horse?\u2019 And he\u2019d come up with\nthe conclusion that he\u2019d maximize his utility.\u201d That wouldn\u2019t take us very far\nif we were interested in horses, but we aren\u2019t really interested in horses at\nall. What Devons said was, I think, part of the problem, but not the whole of\nit. I think it\u2019s not really the most important objection \u2013 the lack of\nrealism.\n\n>\n\n> What I think is important is that economists don\u2019t study the working of the\neconomic system. That is to say, they don\u2019t think they\u2019re studying any system\nwith all its interrelationships. It is as if a biologist studied the\ncirculation of the blood without the body. It is a pretty gory thought, but it\nwouldn\u2019t get you anywhere. You wouldn\u2019t be able to discuss the circulation of\nthe blood in a sensible way. And that\u2019s what happens in economics. In fact the\neconomic system is extremely complicated. You have large firms and small\nfirms, differentiated firms and narrowly specialized firms, vertically\nintegrated firms and those single-stage firms; you have in addition non-profit\norganizations and government entities \u2013 and all bound together, all operating\nto form the total system. But how one part impinges on the other, how they are\ninterrelated, how it actually works \u2013 that is not what people study. What is\nwrong is the failure to look at the system as the object of study.\n\n",

Emotions are\npartly expressed through the muscles. If you are determined to not show an\nemotion, you have to tighten the muscles used to express it. For example, not\nlaughing or not crying requires tightening your chest and your face.\n\nThis is probably no big deal if you're doing it some of the time in some\nparticular situations, but if you believe those emotions may never be shown\n(or never shown in response to particular thoughts), then the tension becomes\nstabilized because you never know when those thoughts might happen.\n\n",

Edrie has just butted\nhorns with a male peer over his conception of what makes a good technical\nleader: \"we have nothing against competent unmarried women, like you, but...\".\nBut upon finding herself alone with Jerry, Edrie acknowledges that her\ncolleague does have a point, taking Jerry somewhat by surprise.\n\n  * J: \"Why do you think fathers are such good leadership material?\" [...] \n  * E: \"That's easy.

They have power over a woman, which they convert into services that support them in their work. Single men have much more work to do just taking care of themselves, so they are at a disadvantage.\" [...] \n  * J: \"A lot of men would see it differently. They would say that the married woman is converting her sexual power over the man into money power - a guaranteed lifetime of support.\" [...] \n  * E:\"There's no contradiction in both people using power at the same time and converting it into something they both want more.\" \n\n",

What she does, leading up over a number of pages to those\nsections that in other writers would be identified as infodumps, is carefully\nbuild the foundation for a question -- and then, when she writes that section,\nshe answers that question. Which means that by that time the reader is so\neager for the information that it doesn't come across as an infodump at all.\n\n[ Suzzette Haden Elgin ](http://ozarque.livejournal.com/647242.html?nc=7)\n\n",

But if,\nwhen a man publishes his discoveries, he either through a design, or through\nhabit, omit the intermediary steps by which he himself arrived at them, it is\nno wonder that his speculations confound them, and that the generality of\nmankind stand amazed at his reach of thought. If a man ascend to the top of a\nbuilding by the help of a common ladder, but cut away most of the steps after\nhe has done with them, leaving only every ninth of tenth step, the view of the\nladder, in the condition which he has pleased to exhibit it, gives us a\nprodigious, but unjust view of the man who could have made use of it. But if\nhe had intended that any body should follow him, he should have left the\nladder as he constructed it, or perhaps as he found it, for it might have been\na mere accident that threw it in his way...

A\nsimilar illusion seems to haunt nations through every stage of the long\nprogress from poverty and barbarism to the highest degrees of opulence and\ncivilization. But if we resolutely chase the mirage backward, we shall find it\nrecede before us into the regions of fabulous antiquity. It is now the fashion\nto place the golden age of England in times when noblemen were destitute of\ncomforts the want of which would be intolerable to a modern footman, when\nfarmers and shopkeepers breakfasted on loaves the very sight of which would\nraise a riot in a modern workhouse, when to have a clean shirt once a week was\na privilege reserved for the higher class of gentry, when men died faster in\nthe purest country air than they now die in the most pestilential lanes of our\ntowns, and when men died faster in the lanes of our towns than they now die on\nthe coast of Guiana.\n\n.................................\n\n> We too shall in our turn be outstripped, and in our turn be envied. It may\nwell be, in the twentieth century, that the peasant of Dorsetshire may think\nhimself miserably paid with twenty shillings a week; that the carpenter at\nGreenwich may receive ten shillings a day; that laboring men may be as little\nused to dine without meat as they are now to eat rye bread; that sanitary\npolice and medical discoveries may have added several more years to the\naverage length of human life; that numerous comforts and luxuries which are\nnow unknown, or confined to a few, may be within the reach of every diligent\nand thrifty workingman. And yet it may then be the mode to assert that the\nincrease of wealth and the progress of science have benefited the few at the\nexpense of the many, and to talk of the reign of Queen Victoria as the time\nwhen England was truly merry England, when all classes were bound together by\nbrotherly sympathy, when the rich did not grind the faces of the poor, and\nwhen the poor did not envy the splendor of the rich.\n\n",

It is\neasy to turn the statistical crank. With sufficiently powerful statistical\ntools, you can find a significant statistical relationship between just about\nanything and anything else.\n\n>\n\n> Psychologists see no real problem with the current dogma. They are used to\ngetting messy results that can be dealt with only by statistics. In fact, I\nhave now detected a positive suspicion of quality results amongst\npsychologists. In my experiments I get relationships between variables that\nare predictable to within 1 percent accuracy. The response to this level of\nperfection has been that the results must be trivial! It was even suggested to\nme that I use procedures that would reduce the quality of the results, the\nimplication being that noisier data would mean more.\n\n>\n\n> After some recovery period I realized that this attitude is to be expected\nfrom anyone trying to see the failure of the input-output model as a success.\nSocial scientists are used to accounting for perhaps 80% (at most) of the\nvariance in their data. They then look for other variables that will account\nfor more variance. This is what gives them future research studies. The\npremise is that behavior is caused by many variables. If I account for all the\nvariance with just one variable, it\u2019s no fun and seems trivial.\n\n>\n\n> If psychologists had been around at the time that physics was getting\nstarted, we\u2019d still be Aristotelian, or worse. There would be many studies\nlooking for relationships between one physical variable and another\u2014e.g.,\nbetween ball color and rate of fall, or between type of surface and the amount\nof snow in the driveway. Some of these relationships would prove statistically\nsignificant. Then when some guy comes along and shows that there is a nearly\nperfect linear relationship between distance traveled and acceleration, there\nwould be a big heave of \u201ctrivial\u201d or \u201ctoo limited\u201d\u2014what does this have to do\nwith the problems we have keeping snow out of the driveway?\n\n>\n\n> Few psychologists recognize that, whatever their theory, it is based on the\nopen-loop input-output model. There is no realization that the very methods by\nwhich data are collected imply that you are dealing with an open-loop system.\nTo most psychologists, the methods of doing research are simply the scientific\nmethod\u2014the only alternative is superstition. There is certainly no realization\nthat the input-output model is testable and could be shown to be false. In\nfact, the methods are borrowed, in caricature, from the natural sciences,\nwhere the open-loop model works very well, thank you. Progress in the natural\nsciences began dramatically when it was realized that the inanimate world is\nnot purposive.\n\n>\n\n> Psychologists have mistakenly applied this model of the inanimate world to\nthe animate world, where it simply does not apply.\n\n>\n\n> This was a forgivable mistake in the days before control theory, because\nbefore 1948 there was no understanding of how purposive behavior could work.\nNow we know, but the social sciences have their feet sunk in conceptual\nconcrete.

A very endearing sight, I'm sure you will agree,\nand even as I watched, the mother otter dived into the water and came up with\na plump salmon, which she subdued and dragged onto a half-submerged log. As\nshe ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember\nto its day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the\ndelight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the\ndelicacy.

Look up the costs of solar farms;\nabout $3 per peak watt. Their average power output is less; we can very\noptimistically assume that they run at 20% of capacity on average. Efficiency\nlosses from electrolysis and fuel cells are about 50%. Putting it all\ntogether, this would cost about $30 per watt of average power delivered. Not\nincluding the cost of the fuel cells.\n\nA little googling will show that the total cost of building two new AP1000\nreactors in Georgia is about $14 billion, and they average at least 93% of\ntheir peak power, and transmission line losses bring their average power\ndelivered to about 1000 MW each. So their cost is about $7 per watt of average\npower delivered, or about 23% the cost of solar.\n\nThere's a lot of extremely harmful bullshit out there, and defeating most of\nit doesn't take any advanced techniques; it just takes a willingness to look\nup some relevant numbers and do a bit of arithmetic.\n\n",

        "markdown": "[ Link ](http://www.fatuosity.net/2010/03/19/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-\nnatural-body/)\n\n> One of the points Lesley makes is that the idea of \u2018nature\u2019 is actually a\ncultural construct. What do we mean when we say something is \u2018natural\u2019? I\nthink that, in general, we mean that it hasn\u2019t been altered or intervened with\nin anyway. Which is completely impossible. Everything we do changes our body\nin some way. Not doing something changes our body in some other way.\nEverything you eat becomes a part of you. And if you don\u2019t eat, well, that has\nother implications. Breathing air, drinking water, wearing clothes, walking,\ndriving, sitting, standing, sleeping, all of these things alter the body in\nsome way. The body is always in flux, and we can\u2019t live without taking in\nthings from our environment, things which change us. An unaltered body is, by\ndefinition, not alive. (This is highly influenced by a presentation I recently\nattended by Rachael Kendrick on metabolism, and while I\u2019m sure I\u2019m this is an\nobscene misappropriation of her argument, I found it very interesting.\nKendrick isn\u2019t always entirely fat-positive, but she does an excellent\ncritique of medial science and obesity epidemic discourse.)\n\n>\n\n> The ideal \u2018natural\u2019 body is also frequently invoked in anti-fat rhetoric,\nparticularly in the figure of the \u2018caveman\u2019. In fact, some people call for a\nreturn to this way of eating (if not this way of living). The idea is that the\nhuman body is ideally suited to a palaeolithic lifestyle and that our\ndigestive systems work best if we eat only foods that were around 2 million\nyears ago, and avoid all that new-fangled stuff like \u2018grains\u2019 and \u2018beans\u2019.\nThis idea basically harnesses the discourse of evolution in the service of\nwhat amounts to a creationist argument. It posits that the ideal human design\nwas arrived at somewhere in the deep and distant past, and has remained\nconstant ever since. It denies evolution as an ongoing process, and most\nimportantly, ignores the fact that the caveman body was as much a product of\nits environment as the modern human body is.\n\nI think \"natural\" can work as a hypothesis for making things better, but it's\njust a hypothesis, not a source of reliable truth.\n\n",

There's no\nbuffer zone that we've found in any of the physical laws of how the universe\nworks to make room for free will. There's non-determinism; but there's not\nchoice. Choice is the introduction of something, dare I say it, supernatural:\nsome influence that isn't part of the physical interaction, which allows some\nclusters of matter and energy to decide how they'll collapse a probabilistic\nwaveform into a particular reality.\n\n\\-- [ Mark Chu-Carroll\n](http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/10/sloppy_dualism_on_bad_astronom.php)\n\n",

For the Intelligent Design people,\ncomplexity can arise only by design; for Dawkins, complexity can arise only\nfrom simplicity. But if either of these conclusions were correct, it would\napply equally well to arithmetic. Not even religious people believe that\narithmetic was designed by God, and not even Dawkins believes that arithmetic\nevolved through natural selection.

To live is to be separated from what we were in order to approach\nwhat we are going to be in the mysterious future. Solitude is the profoundest\nfact of the human condition. Man is the only being who knows he is alone, and\nthe only one who seeks out another. His nature -- if that word can be used in\nreference to man, who has \"invented\" himself by saying \"No\" to nature --\nconsists in his longing to realize himself in another. Man is nostalgia and a\nsearch for communion. Therefore, when he is aware of himself he is aware of\nhis lack of another, that is, of his solitude.\n\n\\-- Octavio Paz, The labyrinth of Solitude\n\n",

If you think you've got what it takes, you may fail\nto learn what you need to know in order to use whatever qualities you may\nhave. On the other hand, if you think you do not have what it takes, you may\ngive up too easily, thinking it is useless to try. A poet is someone - you,\nme, anyone - who writes poems.

Its failure, or put more generously, its shortcoming, was\ncaused by ignorance of how the brain works. That in my opinion is the whole\nstory. No one, philosopher or scientist, could explain the physical acts of\nobservation and reasoning in other than highly subjective terms. [...] The\ncanonical definition of objective scientific knowledge avidly sought by the\nlogical positivists is not a philosophical problem nor can it be attained, as\nthey hopes, by logical and semantic analysis. It is an empirical question that\ncan be answered only by a continuing probe of the physical basis of the\nthought process itself. The most fruitful procedures will almost certainly\ninclude the use of artificial intelligence, aided in time by the still\nembryonic field of artificial emotion, to simulate complex mental operations.\n\n\\--- Edward O.

The walls of my\nprison crumbled and fell, the dungeon was flooded with light, and all the\nbolts, and bars, and manacles became dust. I was no longer a servant, a serf,\nor a slave. There was for me no master in all the wide world \u2014 not even in\ninfinite space. I was free \u2014 free to think, to express my thoughts \u2014 free to\nlive to my own ideal \u2014 free to live for myself and those I loved \u2014 free to use\nall my faculties, all my senses \u2014 free to spread imagination\u2019s wings \u2014 free to\ninvestigate, to guess and dream and hope \u2014 free to judge and determine for\nmyself \u2014 free to reject all ignorant and cruel creeds, all the \u201cinspired\u201d\nbooks that savages have produced, and all the barbarous legends of the past \u2014\nfree from the popes and priests \u2014 free from all the \u201ccalled\u201d and \u201cset apart\u201d \u2014\nfree from sanctified mistakes and holy lies \u2014 free from the fear of eternal\npain \u2014 free from the winged monsters of the night \u2014 free from devils, ghosts,\nand gods. For the first time I was free. There were no prohibited places in\nall the realms of thought \u2014 no air, no space, where fancy could not spread her\npainted wings \u2014 no chains for my limbs \u2014 no lashes for my back \u2014 no fires for\nmy flesh \u2014 no master\u2019s frown or threat \u2014 no following another\u2019s steps \u2014 no\nneed to bow, or cringe, or crawl, or utter lying words. I was free. I stood\nerect and fearlessly, joyously, faced all worlds.\n\n>\n\n> And then my heart was filled with gratitude, with thankfulness, and went out\nin love to all the heroes, the thinkers who gave for the liberty of hand and\nbrain \u2014 for the freedom of labor and thought \u2014 to those who fell in the fierce\nfields of war, to those who died in dungeons bound with chains \u2014 to those who\nproudly mounted scaffold\u2019s stairs \u2014 to those whose bones were crushed, whose\nflesh was scarred and torn \u2014 to those by fire consumed \u2014 to all the wise, the\ngood, the brave of every land, whose thoughts and deeds have given freedom to\nthe sons of men. And then I vowed to grasp the torch that they had held, and\nhold it high, that light might conquer darkness still.\n\n\u2014 Robert G. Ingersoll\n\n",

Was that what you call the Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct?\" But\nsurely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there\nare such things. If we did-if we really thought that there were people going\nabout who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers\nfrom him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or\ndrive them mad or bring bad weather, surely we would all agree that if anyone\ndeserved the death penalty, then these filthy quislings did. There is no\ndifference of moral principle here: the difference is simply about matter of\nfact. It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there\nis no moral advance in not executing them when you do not think they are\nthere.

Disputants speak to one another\u2014or, rather, at one another\u2014as if\ntheir interlocutors failed to pay adequate attention on the day elementary\nmorality was explained. Unaware of the projective nature of value, they marvel\nat their opponents\u2019 blindness, their utter failure to see what is so perfectly\nobvious. Not knowing what else to do, they scold their opponents as if they\nwere children, and scold them as if they were _ belligerent _ children when\nthey fail to respond the first time.\n\n>\n\n> What to do about this? Take a cue from good writers. Stick to the facts.\nKeep evaluative language to a minimum, and get rid of the most overtly\njudgmental, moralistic language.\n\n\\-- Joshua Greene, _ The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Truth About\nMorality And What To Do About It _\n\n",

To create valuable final products, we mix inexpensive\ningredients together according to a recipe. The cooking one can do is limited\nby the supply of ingredients, and most cooking in the economy produces\nundesirable side effects. If economic growth could be achieved only by doing\nmore and more of the same kind of cooking, we would eventually run out of raw\nmaterials and suffer from unacceptable levels of pollution and nuisance. Human\nhistory teaches us, however, that economic growth springs from better recipes,\nnot just from more cooking. New recipes generally produce fewer unpleasant\nside effects and generate more economic value per unit of raw material.\n\n. . .\n\nEvery generation has perceived the limits to growth that finite resources and\nundesirable side effects would pose if no new recipes or ideas were\ndiscovered. And every generation has underestimated the potential for finding\nnew recipes and ideas. We consistently fail to grasp how many ideas remain to\nbe discovered. The difficulty is the same one we have with compounding:\npossibilities do not merely add up; they multiply.\n\n\\- Paul M.

But when all is\nsaid and done, and all the tricky arguments and distinctions and\ncounterexamples have been discovered, presumably we will still face the\nquestion which prices are worth paying, which theories are on balance\ncredible, which are the unacceptably counterintuitive consequences and which\nare the acceptably counterintuitive ones.

It is the invention of a possible world, or of a tiny fraction of\nthat world. The conjecture is then exposed to criticism to find out whether or\nnot that imagined world is anything like the real one. Scientific reasoning is\ntherefore at all levels an interaction between two episodes of thought \u2014 a\ndialogue between two voices, the one imaginative and the other critical; a\ndialogue, as I have put it, between the possible and the actual, between\nproposal and disposal, conjecture and criticism, between what might be true\nand what is in fact the case.\n\n>\n\n> In this conception of the scientific process, imagination and criticism are\nintegrally combined. Imagination without criticism may burst out into a comic\nprofusion of grandiose and silly notions. Critical reasoning, considered\nalone, is barren. The Romantics believed that poetry, _ poiesis _ , the\ncreative exploit, was the very opposite of analytic reasoning, something lying\nfar above the common transactions of reason with reality. And so they missed\none of the very greatest of all discoveries, of the synergism between\nimagination and reasoning, between the inventive and critical faculties.\n\nPeter Medawar \u2014 Pluto\u2019s Republic, \u201cScience and Literature\u201d, p. 46\n\n",

When,\nafter dispassionate examination, you cannot prove your beliefs false, then\nperhaps you are on the way to discovering some sort of truth.\n\n\\-- Eamon Collins, terrorist-turned-informer, from his memoir _ Killing Rage _\n\n",
